<h2><a name="Chapter_I" id="Chapter_I"><span class="smcap">Chapter I</span></a><br />
<small><i>A Dangerous Ride</i></small></h2>


<p>A blue sports roadster, driven by a girl in a
lovely crÃªpe suit of the same color, threaded its
way through the traffic of Spring City's streets
to the concrete road that led to the aviation
field on the outskirts. Passing the city's limits,
the car sped along under the easy assurance of
its competent driver, whose eyes were bluer
than its paint, deeper than the dress that she
was wearing. They were shining now with happiness,
for the end of this ride promised the
most thrilling experience of her life. That afternoon
Linda Carlton was to have her first flight
in an airplane!</p>

<p>She parked her car outside of the field and
locked it cautiously. Jumping out, she fairly
skipped inside the boundary.</p>

<p>A tall, good-looking young man in a flier's
suit came from one of the hangars to meet her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Carlton?" he said, extending his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Mr. Mackay. You see I'm here&mdash;a
little early, I expect. You haven't forgotten
your promise?"</p>

<p>His pleasant face darkened, and he looked
doubtfully at the sky.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it may rain, Miss Carlton. We've
suspended pleasure trips for today. But perhaps
tomorrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she cried in deep disappointment,
and the young man believed that her eyes grew
moist. "I can't get away tomorrow, or any
other day this week. You see I'm a senior at
school, and I'm just rushed to death."</p>

<p>"Well, that's too bad," he said, looking again
at the sky. "And of course it may not rain after
all. But orders are orders, you know."</p>

<p>The girl looked down at the ground, probably,
he thought, to hide the tears that would come to
her eyes. She was so pretty, so serious, so anxious
to go up. It evidently wasn't only a whim
with her; she really wanted to fly&mdash;like Amelia
Earhart, and Elinor Smith. How he hated to
deny her!</p>

<p>"Isn't there something you could do?" she
finally asked. "Take me up as one of your
friends&mdash;not as a visitor to the aviation field....
Why, Mr. Mackay, suppose your sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
came to see you today, wouldn't you be allowed
to take her up?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, smiling. "But that would
be on my responsibility, not the school's."</p>

<p>"Then," she pleaded, and she was radiant
again with enthusiasm, "couldn't <i>I</i> be your responsibility?"</p>

<p>He nodded, won over to her wishes.</p>

<p>"If you put it that way, Miss Carlton, I can't
refuse! But I'll have to take you in the plane
I'm working on now&mdash;making some tests with&mdash;and
it isn't the most reliable plane in the
world. Not one we use to take visitors up in."</p>

<p>"But if it's safe enough for you, it's safe
enough for me. I'm satisfied."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid your parents wouldn't be," he
objected.</p>

<p>"There I think you're wrong," she asserted.
"My father believes in taking chances. He has
always let me do dangerous things&mdash;ride horseback,
and drive a car and swim far out in the
ocean.... And my mother is dead."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," agreed Mackay. "Please
come over here with me. I have been trying to
fix up an old biplane, and I think I have her in
shape now. But we'll both wear parachutes for
precaution."</p>

<p>Her heart fluttering wildly from happiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
but not at all from fear, Linda accompanied the
young flier across the huge field to the runway,
where a biplane was resting in readiness for its
test. Mackay put her into the cockpit, examined
the engine again, and the parachutes, helped
her to fasten one of the latter on, in case of an
accident, and started the motor. A minute later
the plane taxied forward, faster and faster,
until it rose from the ground.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Linda, in a tone of deepest joy,
although her companion could not hear her for
the roar of the motor. "Oh, I'm so happy!"</p>

<p>Up, up, up they went, until they reached the
clouds, where the atmosphere seemed misty and
foggy. But it did not matter to Linda that the
sky was not blue; nothing could spoil the ecstasy
she experienced in knowing that at last she was
where she had always longed to be.</p>

<p>Never for a moment was she the least bit
dizzy. The sensation of floating through the air
was more marvelous than anything she had ever
dreamed of.</p>

<p>For some minutes she just allowed herself to
dream of the future when she herself would be
in control of a plane, sailing thus through the
skies. Then she remembered with a start that
if she ever expected her ambitions to be fulfilled,
it would be necessary to learn how flying was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
accomplished. She began to examine everything
in the cockpit. It was too noisy to ask her companion
any questions, but she watched him carefully
and tried to figure out what she could for
herself. She identified the joystick, which controlled
the plane, and she recognized the compass
and the altimeter, which registered the
height&mdash;now sixteen hundred feet&mdash;to which
they had climbed. All the while she made mental
notes of questions she would ask her pilot
when they reached the ground.</p>

<p>Up, up they went until at last they were beyond
the clouds, and saw the bright sunshine
about them. It was symbolic to Linda; she resolved
that in after life, whenever she was
unhappy or distressed, she would fly on wings
to the clear sunlight above. It was almost as if
there she would actually find God.</p>

<p>She was so happy that it was some time before
she noticed the queer sound the motor was
making. Then, glancing questioningly at her
companion, she saw a tight, drawn look about
his lips, a ghastly pallor in his face. Something
was evidently wrong! The motor made an uneven
sound, threatening to stall, and the plane
went into a tail-spin. Mackay was frantically
leaning forward, doing something she did not
understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Motor's dying!" he cried, as he managed to
right the plane. His voice shook with greater
dread than he had ever before experienced. For,
fearless though he was for himself, he was
scared to death for the pretty girl at his side.</p>

<p>What a fool he had been, he thought, to allow
her to come! He would give his own chances of
safety that minute if she could be sure of her
life! So young, so sweet, so utterably lovely! A
great lump rose in his throat, as he took another
look at his engine. But he was helpless.</p>

<p>Grim with terror, he pointed to her parachute.
And then, to his amazement, he realized
how perfectly calm she was!</p>

<p>"You step off first," he said, thankful they
both had their parachutes. "I'll stay with the
plane as long as I can."</p>

<p>Never in his life did Ted Mackay go through
such a horrible moment as that instant when
Linda Carlton, at a height of two thousand feet,
stepped so bravely from the edge of the plane
into the yawning space below. Even if he himself
were killed, he could never know sharper
agony. Yet the girl herself was gamely smiling!</p>

<p>He managed to pilot the plane a little farther,
in the hope that when it did crash, it would not
come anywhere near her, and then, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
could no longer keep it from falling, he stepped
off himself.</p>

<p>Down he went, and his parachute opened with
perfection, but he, in his tenseness, thought
only of Linda, and of her luck with hers. And
he prayed as he had never prayed before in his
life, not even at his most perilous moments,
where death seemed most certain.</p>

<p>No descent ever seemed so slow, so prolonged,
but at last he reached the ground. And there,
still smiling at him, was lovely Linda Carlton!</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_II" id="Chapter_II"><span class="smcap">Chapter II</span></a><br />
<small><i>Graduation</i></small></h2>


<p>"Thank Heaven you're safe!" cried Ted
Mackay, as he disentangled himself from his
parachute. "You certainly are a game little
sport, Miss Carlton!"</p>

<p>"I don't see why," returned Linda. "People
jump from planes with parachutes every day!"</p>

<p>"I know. But it was all so sudden. And it is
always a pity when anyone's first flight ends
disastrously. It makes you feel that you never
want to see an airplane again."</p>

<p>"Well, it won't make me feel that way," replied
the girl, lightly. "I'd go up again right
away if you'd take me."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't. But I'm mighty glad to
hear you talk that way. I think you're cut out
for a flier. Now let's hunt the wreck."</p>

<p>After they had located the damaged plane,
and examined its shattered pieces, they hiked
back to the aviation field together, talking all
the while about flying. Linda asked Ted one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
question after another, which he answered as
well as he could without having a plane to demonstrate,
and he promised to lend her some
books on the subject.</p>

<p>"You must come over and take a course of
instruction at our Flying School," he advised.
"As soon as you can."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope to!" she assured him, eagerly.
"Maybe after I graduate. Why, I'm almost
eighteen! Most boys of my age who cared as
much about it as I do would have been flying a
couple of years. Because you can get a license
when you're sixteen, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... It's going to be fun to teach you,"
he added, as they approached the field, and
Linda stopped beside her car. "Good-by! I'll
expect to see you soon!"</p>

<p>His hope, however, was not fulfilled until two
weeks later, when Linda again slipped over to
the field, between engagements, for another ride
in the air. This time she was only one among
a group of visitors, and she went up in a plane
that was both new and trustworthy.</p>

<p>Her time was so limited&mdash;it was a week before
Commencement&mdash;that she had only chance
for a few words with Ted Mackay. She told him
that her class-day was the following Friday,
and she timidly invited him to a dance which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
she was giving at her home the night before
the event.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," he said, more thrilled
than he dared tell her at the invitation, "but I
couldn't possibly come.... You see, Miss
Carlton&mdash;I wouldn't fit in with your set."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Linda in disappointment,
"We're not snobs, just because we go to
Miss Graham's school!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, put it this way," he added: "I'm
absolutely on my own&mdash;and I don't even have
evening clothes!"</p>

<p>She smiled at his frankness, but she did not
know that he told only part of his story&mdash;that
he was supporting his mother and helping to
put his younger sister through High School.</p>

<p>"All right, then&mdash;have it your own way&mdash;Ted,"
she agreed, holding out her hand. "I'll
hope to see you some time after class-day."</p>

<p>From that hour on, it seemed as if every
moment was filled with more things than she
could possibly do. At last Friday came&mdash;as hot
as any day in mid-summer, though it was still
early June.</p>

<p>Soon after two o'clock the audience began to
arrive, and at half-past, the twenty-two graduates,
in their white dresses, with their large
bouquets or American Beauties or pink rose-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>buds,
filed in to take their seats on the flower-decked
platform in the garden of the school
grounds.</p>

<p>Fans waved, and the flowers wilted visibly,
but nobody seemed to notice. For with the exercises
the fun began, and everybody listened
intently to the jokes and the compliments which
came in turn to each and every member of
Linda Carlton's class.</p>

<p>After Louise Haydock, the president, made
her brief speech of greeting, the presenter took
charge, and her remarks and her presents were
clever without being cruel. Most of the latter she
had purchased from the five-and-ten, but they
all carried a point. To Linda Carlton she gave
a toy car, because she thought that was what
the latter was most interested in, and then she
asked her to wait a moment, that she had something
else for her.</p>

<p>Linda stood still, smiling shyly, and wondering
whether her next gift would have anything
to do with airplanes.</p>

<p>"Linda," continued the presenter, "we have
this bracelet for you&mdash;in token of our affection.
You have been voted the most popular girl in
the class."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Linda, and her eyelids fluttered
in embarrassment. She was so surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
that she didn't know what to say. Some of the
other girls, who had been secretly hoping for
this honor, which was always kept as a surprise
until class-day, had even prepared speeches.
But Linda had never given the matter a
thought.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;thank you so much," she finally managed
to stammer, as she stepped forward to
receive the bracelet.</p>

<p>The audience stirred and clapped, for the
girl was a favorite with everybody in Spring
City.</p>

<p>"She certainly looks sweet today," whispered
Mrs. Haydock, the mother of Linda's best
friend. "There is nothing so becoming as
white."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed her aunt, who had taken care
of Linda ever since her own mother had died
when she was only a baby, "but I do wish she
hadn't worn those flowers. She had half a
dozen bouquets of American Beauties, and she
picked out those ordinary pink roses! Sometimes
Linda is queer."</p>

<p>"Yes, but who sent them?" inquired the
other woman. "Probably the reason lies there!
Ralph Clavering?"</p>

<p>"Ralph Clavering wouldn't buy a cheap
bouquet like that&mdash;with all his father's mil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>lions!"
exclaimed Miss Carlton. "No; he did
send flowers, but Linda didn't wear them. These
had no card."</p>

<p>Their conversation stopped abruptly, for the
class prophet was being introduced. Twenty-one
girls on the platform leaned forward expectantly,
anxious to hear what the future held
in store for them. Of course nobody actually
believed that this girl could foretell their lives,
but it was always fascinating to speculate about
their fortunes.</p>

<p>She began with the customary jokes.</p>

<p>"Sara Wheeler" (the thinnest girl in the
class), "is going into the food business, but will
eat up the profits. However, she'll weigh two
hundred pounds before she goes bankrupt....</p>

<p>"Sue Emery, on the contrary, will finally
succeed in reducing her weight&mdash;when she gets
away from these girls and stops talking about
it, instead of doing it&mdash;until she becomes Hollywood's
star dancer....</p>

<p>"Linda Carlton and Louise Haydock&mdash;the
double l's, we call them, because they are always
together&mdash;will both marry wealthy men
and become the society leaders of Spring
City...."</p>

<p>At these words, Linda's Aunt Emily nudged
Louise's mother, and smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"That would suit us, wouldn't it, Mrs. Haydock?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Just what we want for our girls!" nodded
her companion, in satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was over at last, the fun and the excitement,
the class-day that the girls would keep in
their memories for the rest of their lives. Hot,
but happy, the graduates came down from the
platform to find their friends and their families.
Some of them wanted to linger, to talk
things over, but Linda Carlton was anxious to
get away. It had been wonderful to receive that
beautiful bracelet, but somehow it would spoil
it to talk about it.</p>

<p>And, in spite of all her happiness, there was
a little hurt in her heart. Her father hadn't
come home for his only child's graduation!</p>

<p>She came to where her aunt was standing,
and put her arm through hers.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Aunt Emily?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Of course, dear&mdash;if you want to go so soon.
But wouldn't you like to stay and see your
friends, and thank them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll write notes," replied Linda.</p>

<p>"There's Ralph Clavering over there," remarked
Miss Carlton, nodding in the direction
of a tall, well-dressed young man on the other
side of the lawn. "You could thank him for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
flowers. He'll probably think it queer if you
don't, especially since you didn't wear them."</p>

<p>Linda smiled carelessly.</p>

<p>"Ralph Clavering probably sent roses to half
a dozen girls today," she said lightly. "It's his
boast that he's in love with the whole class!...
No, I want to go home, Auntie. I'm
tired."</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear. We'll go right away."</p>

<p>Nodding to friends as they walked across the
beautiful garden where the out-door exercises
had been held, they came to Linda's shining
sports roadster, parked just outside the gate.
It had been her father's present to her on the
day that she was sixteen, and she had taken
such care of it that even now, after a year and
a half, it looked almost new.</p>

<p>"I think it was wonderful for you to receive
the bracelet as the most popular girl," Miss
Carlton said, as she got into the car. "Everything
was really perfect&mdash;even the prophecy
about your future."</p>

<p>Linda frowned at the recollection of those
words; she hadn't liked that prophecy at all.
As perhaps only Ted Mackay realized, her ambition
was to fly, to fly so expertly that she
could go to strange lands, do a man's work perhaps,
carry out missions of importance. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
wanted to be known as one of the best&mdash;if not
<i>the</i> best&mdash;aviatrix in America!</p>

<p>Ever since she was a child she had had some
such longing. Perhaps it was her father who
had been responsible for it. Restless and unhappy
after her mother's death, he had given
his baby to his sister to take care of, and had
wandered from one place to another, only coming
home every year or so, to see how Linda
was growing. As if to make up to her for his
absences, he brought her marvelous presents&mdash;presents
that were intended rather for a boy
than for a girl. Early in life she had learned
to shoot a gun, ride a horse, and drive a car.
No wonder that she dreamed of airplanes!</p>

<p>Her aunt, on the other hand, disapproved of
this way of bringing up a girl. She wanted
Linda to be just like the other fashionable
wealthy young ladies in Spring City, to spend
her time at parties and at the Country Club,
and later to marry a rich man&mdash;like Ralph
Clavering. Naturally the words of the class
prophet pleased her.</p>

<p>Nor had she any idea that Linda did not
agree with her, for her niece had always kept
her dreams to herself. There was no use talking
about them, Linda thought, for her aunt
would never understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I guess the prophet was about right,"
continued Miss Carlton. "Any girl that gets
seven bunches of flowers from seven different
boys, won't have any difficulty getting married."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to get married, Aunt
Emily!" protested Linda.</p>

<p>"Not yet, dear&mdash;of course. Why, you're only
seventeen! I couldn't spare you now&mdash;just when
you're free to be at home with me. Besides, I
think every girl should have two years at least
to do exactly as she pleases!"</p>

<p>Exactly as she pleases! Why, that would
mean learning to fly! Oh, if Aunt Emily could
know the fierce longing in her heart to become
a really fine pilot, to train herself to make her
mark in the world!</p>

<p>"So I want you to have a happy, care-free
summer," continued the other, totally unaware
of her niece's thoughts. "At first I thought we
would go abroad, but on the whole that would
be too strenuous, after this hectic year. The
other girls' mothers agree with me. Mrs. Haydock
and I were talking about it today, and
we've practically decided to go to a charming
resort on Lake Michigan that she says is most
exclusive. There you can be with all your best
friends."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Linda said nothing; she just couldn't be enthusiastic
about wasting three months in that
fashion. When she had been hoping to stay
at home and enroll for a course at the Spring
City Flying School!</p>

<p>"You'd like that, wouldn't you, dear?" persisted
Miss Carlton, as Linda steered her car
through the wide gates of their spacious estate.
"You could swim and drive and play tennis
and dance to your heart's content! With Louise&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;the
Claverings! Mrs. Haydock
told me they are going there too. Why, you'd
meet all the right people!"</p>

<p>Linda sighed. Aunt Emily's ideas of the
right people were not exactly hers&mdash;particularly
at the present time. She wanted to meet
flyers, men and women noted in the field of
aviation, not merely wealthy society folk. But
she could not say that to her aunt; the latter
was afraid of airplanes, and had only grudgingly
given her consent that Linda go up in
one. Naturally she had never mentioned her
accident.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll talk our plans over later," said
Miss Carlton, when Linda failed to make a
reply. "I guess you're too tired to think about
anything now. And," she added as she stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
from the car, "don't you want to leave your
car here, and let Thomas put it away?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Auntie," she replied, for she
did not like even so capable a chauffeur as
Thomas to touch her precious roadster. "It'll
only take a minute."</p>

<p>As Linda walked slowly back to the house,
she was thinking of Ted Mackay. For she believed
those wilted flowers at her waist were
his. There had been no card, but they had come
from a small flower shop at the other end of
Spring City&mdash;not the expensive shop that most
of her friends patronized. She would go over
to the school soon, and thank him. But she
would have to tell him that she was obliged to
give up her own plans for the summer! Tears
of disappointment came into her eyes, and she
wondered if there weren't some way it could be
arranged. Maybe if she asked her father....</p>

<p>The thought of her father drove everything
out of her mind. He hadn't even bothered to
come home! Nothing else seemed to matter.</p>

<p>As she entered the living-room, she found her
aunt waiting for her.</p>

<p>"Come in, dear&mdash;and get some rest," said
Miss Carlton. "You look so tired that you
actually seem unhappy."</p>

<p>Linda forced a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is something worrying you, dear? Or is it
just the heat and the rush?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered the girl, sinking
into a deep chair by the window. "I&mdash;I&mdash;guess
I'm just foolish, Aunt Emily." There was a
catch in her voice. "But I'm so disappointed
that Daddy didn't come for my Commencement.
And I wrote to the ranch three times to
remind him!"</p>

<p>Miss Carlton nodded; her brother's ways
were past her understanding. How anybody
could be so indifferent to such a lovely daughter
as Linda! And yet when he was home, no
father could be more affectionate. It was just
that he was absent-minded, that he hated to
be tied down to dates and places. He might be
at his ranch in Texas now, or he might have
wandered off to Egypt or to South America,
without even telling his family. He had been
like that, ever since Linda's mother had died.</p>

<p>"I'm not so surprised at that as I am at his
not sending you a present," commented Miss
Carlton. "He may never have received your
letters&mdash;or he may drop in a week late....
But you mustn't let that worry you, Linda&mdash;you
have to take your father as he is.... And
you must get some rest for tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow?" repeated the girl, vaguely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. The Junior League Picnic. You
haven't told me whom you invited."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You forgot to invite anybody!" laughed
Miss Carlton. "I know you&mdash;why, you're something
like your father about social engagements,
my dear! And of course all the nicest
boys will be asked already! I know that Louise
is going with Ralph Clavering&mdash;Mrs. Haydock
told me today."</p>

<p>"That's fine," commented Linda, indifferently.
"They're great pals."</p>

<p>"But whom will you ask? At this late date?"</p>

<p>"I really think I'd rather stay home, Auntie,
if you don't mind. Because&mdash;well&mdash;Daddy
might come&mdash;and I'd hate to be so far away.
They're going all the way over to Grier's
woods, I recall hearing Dot say, and you know
that's at least fifteen miles."</p>

<p>"Of course, dear&mdash;do just as you like," replied
her aunt, putting her motherly arms
around her. "Only don't count too much on
your father's coming!"</p>

<p>So Linda went to bed that night, little thinking
that her plans would be changed the following
morning, and that, in later years, she
was to look back upon that day as one of the
most wonderful of her whole life!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Chapter_III" id="Chapter_III"><span class="smcap">Chapter III</span></a><br />
<small><i>Her Father's Gift</i></small></h2>


<p>As Linda had no plans for the day after
her class exercises, she had intended to sleep
late. But the arrival of her chum, Louise Haydock,
accompanied by Ralph Clavering and his
Harvard room-mate, Maurice Stetson, changed
things for her.</p>

<p>At half-past eight her aunt came into her bedroom,
half apologetically, half smiling.</p>

<p>"Linda dear, I want you to wake up," she
said. "You have company."</p>

<p>"Yes?" replied the girl sleepily.</p>

<p>"You are rested, aren't you? And it's so
much cooler. It's a real June day&mdash;the kind
the poets write about!"</p>

<p>Linda sat up in bed, and blinked her eyes.
Then suddenly she thought of her father. Did
Aunt Emily mean he had come?</p>

<p>"Daddy?" she asked excitedly. "Do you
mean he's here?"</p>

<p>Miss Carlton's smile faded; she had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
meant to mislead her niece. It was cruel to disappoint
her.</p>

<p>"No, dear. It's only Louise&mdash;with Ralph and
another boy. They want you to wake up, and go
on the picnic."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see.... But you know I didn't invite
anybody, Aunt Emily."</p>

<p>"That's just it. You're to go with this other
boy. He's Ralph's room-mate, and he's here on
a visit. You will go, won't you, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, if Lou wants me to. I'll get
dressed right away.... And Auntie, may I
have some strawberries up here, to eat after I
take my shower? That's all the breakfast I'll
want."</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear. I'll send Anna up right
away. And how soon shall I tell Louise that
you'll be ready?"</p>

<p>"Ten minutes!"</p>

<p>Linda jumped out of bed, and began to sing
as she took her cold shower. It was a wonderful
day&mdash;a good world after all! Of course the
picnic would be fun; she was glad now that she
wasn't going to miss it. Lou was a peach to
arrange things for her in this way! And it
would be exciting to meet a new man. She wondered
what he would be like, and hoped she
would find him nice. But, even if she didn't, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
wouldn't be necessary to stay with him all day.
There wasn't much "two's-ing" in their crowd.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later she found her visitors on
the porch, singing and amusing themselves,
for Miss Carlton had gone to oversee the packing
of Linda's lunch. Ralph introduced his
friend, Maurice Stetson, a short, light-haired
youth, who was utterly at ease with everybody,
and who seemed to think that he was born to
be funny. Indeed, he called himself "the prince
of wise-crackers." Linda, who was both sensitive
and shy, was afraid she would be made uncomfortable
by his comments.</p>

<p>"Miss <i>Linda</i> Carlton," he repeated, solemnly
shaking her hand. "The famous Lindy's namesake?...
Let's see&mdash;what year was that when
he flew the Atlantic? About twenty-seven? Why,
you can't be more than three years old!"</p>

<p>Linda smiled; she really couldn't laugh at
the silly remark, though the others seemed to
think him exceedingly witty.</p>

<p>"And is your ambition flying?" he asked.</p>

<p>Linda blushed; she had no desire to admit
her dreams and ambitions to the general public.</p>

<p>"Doesn't everybody want to fly now-a-days?"
she countered.</p>

<p>"Not your uncle Maurice!" replied the youth,
gravely. "My dad gave me a plane, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
wrecked it. I'm through! My flying almost took
me to the angels!"</p>

<p>"What's this?" interrupted Miss Carlton,
coming out on the porch with a hamper of lunch
for the picnic. "You've been in an airplane
accident?"</p>

<p>"And how!" he replied, feelingly.</p>

<p>"Now you see, Linda! You better not go
over to that field again! I'm so afraid of
planes!"</p>

<p>"All right, Aunt Emily," replied the girl,
graciously. "You needn't worry today, anyhow.
We're going to the picnic in cars."</p>

<p>But, had Miss Carlton seen Maurice Stetson
behind the wheel of his yellow sports roadster,
hitting seventy-five miles an hour, and all the
while keeping up a conversation not only with
Linda beside him, but with the couple in the
rumble-seat as well, she would not have felt
so satisfied.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, nothing happened, and the
picnic promised to be lots of fun. The girls had
selected a beautiful wooded spot outside of the
city, where a lovely stream widened into a small
lake, deep enough for swimming.</p>

<p>Most of the others had already arrived in
their cars, when Louise's party drove up. Two
large tents, on opposite sides of the lake, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
been set up early in the morning for bath-houses.</p>

<p>"Everybody into their suits!" cried Sara
Wheeler, who seemed to be managing the picnic,
because her mother was the chaperon.
"First one into the water gets a prize!"</p>

<p>"Then I get it, without even trying," remarked
Harriman Smith, a nice boy, and a particular
friend of Linda's, "because I have mine
on now! I got dressed in it this morning, and
carried my other clothing."</p>

<p>"Lazy brute!" exclaimed Maurice, enviously,
wishing that he had thought of such a labor-saving
device.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes the whole crowd were in
the water, diving and swimming, and ducking
each other, and finally dividing off into sides
for a game of water-polo. It was only when they
actually smelled the steaks that Mrs. Wheeler's
cooks were broiling, that they were finally induced
to leave the lake and get dressed.</p>

<p>A treasure-hunt through the woods was the
program for the afternoon. Linda, who had expected
to be coupled with Maurice Stetson for
this event, was agreeably surprised to find herself
with Ralph Clavering. Louise's doing, in all
probability! No doubt she guessed that her
chum did not care for Maurice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>They walked along slowly, keeping their
eyes on the ground for all possible clews, chatting
at intervals about the class-day and the
usual gossip, and now and then, when they
met other couples, stopping to compare notes.
Finally Ralph spoke about his plans for the
summer months.</p>

<p>"I'm hoping to persuade your aunt to go to
Green Falls with us, Linda," he said. "There
will be quite a bunch of us together. Dot Crowley,
Sue, Sally Wheeler, and of course Lou and
Kit&mdash;from your sorority, and some of the boys
from our frat, besides several from Spring
City. Harry Smith's going to get a job as a
life-guard, and Maurice has promised to go.
We ought to be able to make whoopee, all
right!"</p>

<p>"Sounds good," admitted Linda, absently.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I really think we could pull off
some serious work there."</p>

<p>"Serious work?" repeated Linda. As far as
she knew, Ralph had never done any real work
in his life.</p>

<p>"Yeah. In the competitions, I mean. I think
if we go after it tooth and nail, you and I'd
make a pretty good team to pull down the cup
for the tennis doubles. They have a big meet
at the end of the season that's the talk of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
whole Great Lakes region.... And Sally
swings a mean club in golf. And look at Louise's
diving!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true," agreed Linda. She had
always liked golf and tennis and swimming,
but somehow this year they had all lost their
charm. It was different after you graduated,
she decided. Then you wanted to make something
out of your life&mdash;like Ted Mackay. There
was no more time to be wasted.</p>

<p>"Promise me you'll go," begged Ralph, leaning
over eagerly and putting his hand on her
arm.</p>

<p>Instinctively she drew it away, but before she
could answer, Louise and Maurice appeared
from a cross-path that was hidden by tall
bushes.</p>

<p>"Why, there's my little Lindy!" cried
Maurice, though Linda was several inches
taller than he was. "Grieving for papa?"</p>

<p>"Shedding tears," laughed Linda. But the
words made her think of her own father, and
she grew sober. Suppose he were home now&mdash;waiting
for her! He never stayed more than a
day; how she would hate to miss him!</p>

<p>"Has anybody found the treasure yet?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"I've found <i>two</i> treasures," replied Maurice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
complacently, looking first at Louise and then
at Linda.</p>

<p>"Forget it!" commanded Louise, tersely,
lifting her head. She, like Linda, was tall, but
in that the resemblance ended. Her dark, sleek
hair was short and almost straight, and she
wore earrings&mdash;even in swimming. She said she
felt undressed without them&mdash;"practically immodest,"
were her exact words.</p>

<p>"No, but really&mdash;?" persisted Linda.</p>

<p>A wild shout from Dot Crowley, followed by
a chorus of "Whoopee!" from half a dozen
others, answered Linda's question immediately.
Dot always was lucky. The others ran to the
spot where the crowd was gathered, and Dot,
a tiny, vivacious blonde, who could take child's
parts in the amateur plays, was holding two
boxes of golf balls triumphantly up to view.</p>

<p>"Do I have to give one box to that lazy kid?"
she demanded, pointing scornfully at her long-legged
partner, Jim Valier, who had been languidly
following her around. At the time when
she had discovered the prize, he was lolling
under a tree, resting his "weary bones," as
he said, smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Sure you do!" he drawled. "Didn't I supply
the brains to our combine?"</p>

<p>"Brains!" repeated Dot. "Where did you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
get 'em? I'll have to have you arrested for
stealing 'em, if that's the case! But here&mdash;take
your box!"</p>

<p>"Couldn't possibly," he said, waving them
aside with his cigarette holder. "Besides, I
hardly ever play golf. Too fatiguing."</p>

<p>"How about your school-girl figure?" asked
Maurice. "Aren't you afraid if you don't exercise,
you'll lose it?"</p>

<p>Everybody, even Linda, laughed, for Jim
Valier was about the world's thinnest youth.</p>

<p>"He's really afraid somebody will mistake
him for a golf-stick, and bang a ball with him,"
remarked Ralph.</p>

<p>In groups, and some in pairs, the whole
crowd went back to the lake. After all that
exercise and excitement, everybody wanted another
dip to cool off. It was six o'clock by the
time they all piled into their cars, and half-past
when Linda reached home.</p>

<p>Hoping to find her father, as she had been
hoping every day that week, she dashed up the
steps quickly, merely waving good-by to her
companions as the sports car shot from the
driveway. And then, miraculously, she saw his
beloved face at the door!</p>

<p>"Daddy!" she cried rapturously, rushing
breathlessly into his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>He was taller than Linda, with a straight,
lithe figure like that of a much younger man.
His hair was dark, with just a little gray at
the temples, and his skin deeply tanned from
his out-door life. A sort of habitual smile
played about his lips, as if he had made up his
mind to find life pleasant, no matter what
came.</p>

<p>"My dear little girl!" he said, quietly, patting
her hair. "Will you forgive me for coming
a day too late? Your Aunt Emily tells me that
both Commencement and class-day are over&mdash;and
you are an old Grad now!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't mind, Daddy, so long as
you came today!" she replied, squeezing his
hand. "Maybe it's better this way, because I've
been so rushed lately that I wouldn't have had
much time to see you."</p>

<p>"You must tell me all about everything," he
said, drawing her arm through his, and leading
her down the steps of the porch. Of course
he thought he meant what he said, but Linda
knew from experience that if she did tell him,
he wouldn't be listening. A dreamy expression
so often came into his eyes when she chattered,
and she would wonder what he was thinking
of. Strange lands&mdash;or his ranch out west&mdash;or
perhaps her mother?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are we going?" she asked. "I really
ought to dress for dinner, Daddy. You know
what picnics are."</p>

<p>"Yes, To be sure. But I want to show you
your graduation present."</p>

<p>"My present?" There was excitement in her
tone; it was sure to be something wonderful&mdash;and
unusual. All the girls were wild with envy
when Kitty Clavering received a real pearl
necklace from her father. All&mdash;except Linda.
She had no desire for pearls, or for any jewelry,
for that matter. She had known that her
father's present would be much more thrilling.
At least&mdash;if he didn't forget!</p>

<p>"You didn't think your old Dad would forget
you, did you, Honey?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;of course not.... But, Daddy,
where is it? Why are we going out back of the
house?"</p>

<p>"We have to walk over to our big field across
the creek," he explained, mysteriously.</p>

<p>"The big field? Why?... That's a hot
walk, Daddy. No shade at all! If you want a
nice walk, we ought to go in the other direction,
down towards the orchard, where there are
some trees."</p>

<p>"Trees are the one thing we don't want," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
replied, solemnly. "You're going to hate trees,
after you get my present, daughter."</p>

<p>"Hate&mdash;trees?" Linda's eyes were traveling
all over the landscape, scanning it in vain for a
clew. And then, as they mounted a slight incline,
the thing came into sight. The marvelous,
wonderful present! Too good to be true! Her
heart stopped beating, her legs shook. She
clutched at her father for support.</p>

<p>A beautiful, shining airplane! A superb Arrow
Sport! The very kind she had been reading
about, had been longing some day to possess!
And even a hangar, to keep it in safety!</p>

<p>"Daddy!" she gasped, hoarsely.</p>

<p>He was watching her face, rapturously.</p>

<p>"You like it?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, wrapping her arms around
his neck, and suddenly bursting into tears.
"How could you know that I wanted it so
much?"</p>

<p>He patted her hair, a little embarrassed by
her emotion.</p>

<p>"I just tried to imagine what I would want
most if I were your age.... You know, dear,
you're your father's own girl! You look like
your mother, but you're much more like me....
A strange mixture...." He was talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
more to himself now, for Linda was almost running,
pulling him along excitedly. "Feminine
beauty&mdash;with masculine ambition...."</p>

<p>But Linda was not listening. She had reached
the plane now, and was walking around it, enthralled.
Touching its smooth surface, to make
sure that it was not only a dream. Dashing
back to hug her father, and then climbing into
the cockpit, to examine the controls, the instruments,
the upholstery. If she lived to be a hundred
years old, no other moment could hold
greater happiness than this!</p>

<p>Her father smiled softly in satisfaction. He
wanted her to have all the happiness that he had
somehow missed. Money couldn't buy it for
him; but money spent for his daughter could
bring it to him in the only possible way now.</p>

<p>"You're not a bit afraid?" he asked, though
he knew from her shining eyes that his question
was unnecessary.</p>

<p>"Dad!"</p>

<p>"And now the question is, who can teach you
to fly? Unfortunately, the man who brought it
here for me couldn't stay, even to explain
things to you&mdash;although of course there is a
booklet. But I understand there's an air school
here at Spring City...."</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" she interrupted. "I've been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
there&mdash;been up with one of the instructors. Can
we drive over for him tonight?"</p>

<p>"My dear, you can't take a lesson at night,"
he reminded her. "You know that."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not!" she agreed, laughing
at her own folly. "But tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly. At least we can see about it.
You have to pass a physical examination first,
I understand."</p>

<p>"And I want to take the regular commercial
pilot's course, Daddy! I want to go to the bottom,
and learn all about planes, and flying.
May I?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why not.... You needn't stop
for the expense."</p>

<p>Linda blushed; she hadn't been thinking of
the expense&mdash;she never did. But perhaps she
ought to now, for the plane must have cost a
lot of money. At the present, however, something
else was worrying her.</p>

<p>"It was the time I was thinking of," she admitted.
"Aunt Emily wants to go away in a
week or so. And oh, Dad, I just couldn't bear
to leave this!" There were actually tears in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course not, dear. Well, we'll see if we
can't compromise with your aunt. Stay at home
the rest of June and July, be content with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
private pilot's license for the present, and then
go away <i>in</i> your plane in August. Wouldn't
that suit you?"</p>

<p>"To the ground&mdash;I mean to the skies!" corrected
the happy girl.</p>

<p>"And now we must get back to dinner," he
reminded her. "Aunt Emily's waiting."</p>

<p>Solemnly, tenderly, as a mother might kiss
her baby, Linda leaned over and kissed the
beautiful plane. Then giving her hand to her
father, she walked back to the house with him
in silence, knowing that now her greatest dream
was fulfilled.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_IV" id="Chapter_IV"><span class="smcap">Chapter IV</span></a><br />
<small><i>Summer Plans</i></small></h2>


<p>The news of Linda's magnificent present
spread like wildfire. She never knew how it got
about, for she didn't call anybody. In fact, she
would have preferred to keep it a secret for that
evening at least, and just spend her time over
the booklet, talking things over with her father.</p>

<p>But of course the rest of the crowd couldn't
understand that. These young people, who saw
their parents every day of their lives, just
couldn't believe that a normal fun-loving girl
like Linda would prefer a father's society to
theirs. They didn't know that Linda had always
longed to know him better, to understand him,
to talk over with him her greatest dreams and
ambitions. Because there had been nobody to
talk to in that intimate fashion. Aunt Emily
never had understood her, and never would.
The kind-hearted woman saw, of course, that
her niece was pleased with her graduation present,
but she could not realize the girl's over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>whelming
joy in the possession of a plane. To
her, even a string of imitation pearls would have
been more desirable.</p>

<p>They talked their plans over at dinner,
Linda's father taking her side in urging that the
vacation be postponed until August.</p>

<p>"You don't mind, do you, Emily?" he asked
his sister.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say I don't mind," she replied,
a little sharply. "But of course I wouldn't spoil
Linda's fun. But I am wondering whether you
have been wise, Tom. Linda is tired out; instead
of going to school and learning some more, she
ought to be resting.... But your presents
have never shown a great deal of wisdom, I
fear."</p>

<p>Her brother laughed.</p>

<p>"Sometimes it's better to be foolish," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Not if Linda breaks her neck!"</p>

<p>"Which she isn't going to do!" contradicted
Mr. Carlton, confidently. "Linda's careful&mdash;and
she's thorough. I know that, from the way
she drives her car&mdash;and takes care of it."</p>

<p>"Cars and airplanes are different matters!"</p>

<p>"Not so different as you might think. In some
ways, cars are more dangerous, because you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
have to consider traffic&mdash;what the other fellow is
going to do. And there's so much room in the
skies!"</p>

<p>"But if something goes wrong&mdash;there's nobody
there to help her," objected Miss Carlton.</p>

<p>"Well, Emily, you'd be amazed at the perfection
of the airplanes they are putting out now-a-days.
They're as different from the old-fashioned
ones of the World War, as the first
two-cylinder automobiles from the sixes and
eights of today."</p>

<p>"But there still are a lot of crashes&mdash;and
deaths," insisted his sister.</p>

<p>"That doesn't say Linda will crash! Linda is
going to be a good pilot&mdash;learn it all thoroughly!...
Why, Emily, you don't think I'd be willing
to take any chances with my only child, do you&mdash;if
I didn't consider it safe?"</p>

<p>He smiled fondly at Linda, but his sister drew
down the corners of her mouth a trifle scornfully.
As if his affection could compare with hers,
though Linda wasn't her own child! He saw the
girl two or three times a year at the most, while
Aunt Emily was with her every day of her life!</p>

<p>"Well," she added, "I'm afraid you'll feel
out of the crowd by the time August comes and
they have been together all that time at Green
Falls!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you mind missing it, my dear?" her
father asked, gently.</p>

<p>"Not a bit!" replied Linda immediately, her
eyes shining at the thought of what she was
gaining.</p>

<p>Miss Carlton abruptly changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Do you remember a man named Clavering,
Tom?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I remember the name. Connected with oil,
wasn't he? Very wealthy?"</p>

<p>"A millionaire, I think," replied Miss Carlton,
as if the news were the most important
thing in the world. "Well, he has bought an
estate just outside of Spring City, and his
daughter has just graduated in Linda's class."</p>

<p>"Yes?" remarked her brother, wondering
what possible difference that could make to him.</p>

<p>"Well, the Claverings are planning to spend
the summer at Green Falls, on Lake Michigan&mdash;the
resort that Mrs. Haydock and I have
selected.... And there is a son in Harvard,
who is going to be there."</p>

<p>"Yes?" It still didn't dawn on the man what
his sister meant. Perhaps that was because he
was not worldly, and money and position didn't
mean much to him. Or perhaps it was because it
had never occurred to him that his little Linda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
was old enough to be thinking about getting
married.</p>

<p>"You certainly are slow at comprehension at
times, Tom," she said, "for a smart man. Do I
have to tell you in so many words that young
Ralph Clavering is interested in Linda?"</p>

<p>Linda blushed, and Mr. Carlton opened his
eyes wide in amazement.</p>

<p>"Well! Well! Well!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Dad!" protested Linda, nervously. "Don't
be so serious! Aunt Emily thinks that because
she loves me, everybody thinks I'm grand. But
as a matter of fact, Ralph Clavering doesn't like
me any better than half a dozen other girls. And
I don't believe he likes me nearly so well as
Louise&mdash;though I haven't given the matter any
thought."</p>

<p>"How any boy could fall for Louise Haydock
is more than I can see!" put in Miss Carlton.
"She is a nice girl, but she has ruined what
looks she had by cutting her hair off so short,
and wearing those dreadful earrings all the
time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aunt Emily!" interrupted Linda. "Please
don't forget that Louise is my best friend!"</p>

<p>"Even so, I don't have to admire her appearance,
do I?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>In a man's fashion, Mr. Carlton was getting
very tired of this small talk. He stirred restlessly.</p>

<p>"Well, it's settled then, about the summer,
isn't it?" he asked. "I'd like to drive over early
tomorrow morning to this Flying School, and
make the arrangements about your course. Because
tomorrow night I'm taking the sleeper
back to the ranch."</p>

<p>"Dad!" cried Linda, in disappointment. "You
don't have to go that soon, do you? Oh, I wanted
you to see me fly!"</p>

<p>"I'll be back again, as soon as I can. But just
now I'm having trouble with some Mexicans who
came over the border and have been threatening
us. I've got to be on the job. My help aren't any
too reliable."</p>

<p>"You won't be in any danger will you,
Daddy?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders indifferently.</p>

<p>"Guess not," he replied.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the meal, Miss Carlton,
who always liked to have Linda's young friends
about, suggested that she call some of them on
the telephone and give them her news, inviting
them over to celebrate with her. But Linda shook
her head.</p>

<p>"There's only one person I'd like to tell about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
it," she said, "and I'm afraid I couldn't reach
him by phone, for I don't know where he lives.
That's a boy over at the school, who has taken
me up a couple of times."</p>

<p>But, as friends like this did not interest her,
Miss Carlton dismissed the subject and went
out to consult her cook. Linda's father, however,
felt differently.</p>

<p>"What's his name?" he asked, indulgently.
"Maybe we could locate him, if we put in a call
at the school. There would probably be somebody
about who would know his address."</p>

<p>"Ted Mackay," answered Linda.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlton's eyes narrowed suspiciously,
and the smile died from his lips. His daughter
trembled. What could he possibly have against
Ted?</p>

<p>"What's the fellow look like?"</p>

<p>"He's big&mdash;with red hair, and blue eyes, Why?
Do you know him, Daddy?"</p>

<p>"Think I know his father&mdash;to my sorrow.
Same name&mdash;description fits, too. Likable chap,
when you first meet him, isn't he? Looks honest
and kind, and all that?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Daddy! And he is so nice, too. And
so clever!"</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it. So is his father&mdash;in his own
way. Well, if he's the son of the man I know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
you're to keep away from him. Do you understand,
daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but Daddy, don't you think it's only
fair to give me a reason?" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"I'd rather not. Can't you take my judgment
as worth something, Linda?" He spoke sternly.</p>

<p>The tears came to Linda's eyes, and she looked
away.</p>

<p>"Mayn't I even speak to him?" she asked,
finally.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly. Never cut anybody&mdash;it's a
sign of a little mind to stoop to such childishness.
But don't be friendly with him. I dare say
there are other instructors at the field, and I'll
arrange for someone else to teach you."</p>

<p>The door-bell rang three times, but before the
maid could answer it, Louise Haydock dashed
into the house, followed by Kitty and Ralph
Clavering, and finally, Maurice Stetson.</p>

<p>"Whoopee!" cried Ralph, almost running
into Linda's father, who was standing in the
dining-room doorway.</p>

<p>"Darling!" exclaimed Louise, embracing her
chum excitedly. "We heard the news! Congratulations!"</p>

<p>"And naturally we couldn't wait to see your
plane," added Kitty. "But are you sure you've
finished dinner?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied Linda, introducing her
father to everybody except Louise, who of
course knew him.</p>

<p>"If it only isn't too dark to see it!" exclaimed
Louise. "We've all brought flashlights."</p>

<p>"Then we better trail out immediately,"
laughed Linda. "And I'll get Aunt Emily. She
has only seen it from a distance."</p>

<p>"Better wait for the rest of the crowd," suggested
Ralph. "I saw Dot trying to round up
some more. They ought to be here any minute."</p>

<p>"Then we might as well wait. Aunt Emily'll
be here in a minute."</p>

<p>"What kind of plane is it, Linda?" inquired
Maurice. "You're 'Lindy' Junior now aren't
you&mdash;just as I predicted," he added.</p>

<p>"It's a 'Pursuit,'" answered Linda, ignoring
his second remark. "An Arrow Sport."</p>

<p>"Open cockpit?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes. See&mdash;here's its picture." She waved
the folder towards the boys. "It's supposed to
be a wonderful little plane for a beginner!"</p>

<p>"From now on, Linda'll talk of nothing but
joysticks and ailerons and&mdash;" began Maurice,
but he was interrupted by the arrival of Dot
Crowley and six other young people, all of whom
had been packed in her small car.</p>

<p>It was just as she liked it to be, Aunt Emily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
thought, as she joined the merry, singing group,
and started out with them towards the field beyond
the house. Mr. Carlton did not go with
them this time, and later on, Linda had reason
to be thankful for his absence.</p>

<p>It was quite dark now, but both the moon and
the stars shone brightly, and the plane was
clearly visible. The exclamations of delight and
praise from her guests were enthusiastic enough
to satisfy any proud owner of such a glorious
prize. Linda was happier than ever.</p>

<p>The boys were naturally interested in the
mechanics of the plane, the girls in the upholstery
of the seats, the charming, deep cushions,
which could be removed if it were necessary to
use a parachute. They turned on their flashlights,
and walked about the biplane, not a little
in awe at the idea of Linda's piloting it through
the skies.</p>

<p>"It only holds two people," remarked Dot,
regretfully. "I wonder if we could pile in extras,
like I do with my car."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," replied Linda. "But I can
take everybody up in turn&mdash;after I get my
license. I am hoping to bring it to Green Falls in
August."</p>

<p>Satisfied at last that they had seen as much as
possible for the present, they started to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
back, when Maurice suddenly spied a lonely
figure at the top of the incline, some fifty yards
away.</p>

<p>"What ho!" he exclaimed. "Who can that be?
Yo-ho-ho!" he cried, making a funnel with his
hands.</p>

<p>"Not anybody in our crowd," replied Jim
Valier, "or he would answer. Hope it isn't a
thief&mdash;with designs on your new plane."</p>

<p>"We better chase him!" said Jackson Stiles,
who was always ready for adventure, "Come
on, fellows, let's rush him!"</p>

<p>The boys darted off, all except Jim Valier,
who said gallantly that he had better stay as
protection for the ladies, though of course everybody
knew it was only because he was too lazy
to run. The girls laughed and chattered while
they were gone&mdash;all except Linda, who waited
nervously to find out what success they had had.</p>

<p>In less than three minutes, however, they had
returned, shamefacedly admitting defeat.</p>

<p>"Maybe the fellow couldn't sprint!" announced
Ralph. "I'll bet he's a track-runner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or a chicken thief!" suggested Maurice.</p>

<p>"Do you think he is a tramp?" inquired Miss
Carlton, relieved that the man had disappeared.
Tramps were so dirty, so unpleasant!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't think so. Big fellow&mdash;not badly
dressed, as far as we could see. Had red hair."</p>

<p>"Too bad we couldn't catch him," remarked
Maurice, always ready with his jokes, "for his
hair was bright enough to light up the plane. We
wouldn't have needed our flashes."</p>

<p>"Might have set the 'Pursuit' on fire!" suggested
Jim.</p>

<p>Linda frowned uneasily. The description
sounded like Ted Mackay. But how did he know
that she had a plane, and if he had happened to
see it, why didn't he come to the house, and ask
her permission to examine it? After all, it was on
their own property&mdash;nobody had any right to
intrude. She thought darkly of what her father
had said, and hoped that there wasn't anything
crooked about Ted. Why, he seemed more of a
friend to her than any of these people&mdash;except
of course her Aunt Emily, and Louise!</p>

<p>By the time they had reached the house, everybody
had forgotten the incident, for Louise
turned on the radio, and without consulting
Linda, they all decided to dance. Ralph claimed
the latter for the first waltz.</p>

<p>"So this will make a change in your summer
plans," he said, as if the idea were not wholly
to his liking.</p>

<p>"Yes. We're not going to Green Falls till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
August&mdash;maybe not then, if I don't succeed in
getting a private pilot's license before that."</p>

<p>"But what about me?" he inquired, and the
admiring look he gave her would have pleased
Miss Carlton, had she noticed it.</p>

<p>Linda looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"You? Why&mdash;you'll never miss me! With all
your girl friends!"</p>

<p>"No; I've decided I'm not going to miss you,"
he said, quietly. "Because I'm going to stay
right here in Spring City, and learn to fly along
with you!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The thing fascinates me. I want a plane,
too! I'm going to touch my Dad for one when I
get home tonight!"</p>

<p>"But you've promised everybody you'll go
to Green Falls!"</p>

<p>"So I will&mdash;August first!"</p>

<p>And so, much to Miss Carlton's delight, when
the rest of the crowd left Spring City the following
week, Ralph Clavering stayed at home with
a couple of the servants, and enrolled at the
same time as Linda, at the Spring City Flying
School.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_V" id="Chapter_V"><span class="smcap">Chapter V</span></a><br />
<small><i>The First Lesson in Flying</i></small></h2>


<p>Early the next morning, Linda wakened her
father and hurried him through his breakfast.
There wasn't a moment to be lost, she told him
excitedly, like a child waiting to open her Christmas
stocking. She had her car under the portico
before he had finished his second cup of coffee.</p>

<p>"Don't drive so fast that you are killed on the
way," cautioned her aunt. "Remember, dear,
you have the rest of your life to fly that plane!"</p>

<p>But the present moment is the only time of
importance to young people, and Linda scarcely
took in what she was saying. Besides, the caution
was unnecessary; unlike Dot Crowley and
Maurice Stetson, she had too much respect for
her car to mistreat it by careless driving. Linda
loved her roadster as a cavalry general loves his
horse.</p>

<p>"You want to do most of your learning on
your own plane, don't you, daughter?" asked
her father, as he sat down beside her. "I mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>&mdash;you'd
rather bring your instructor back with
us, and fly it, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course, if that is possible. But don't you
suppose I have to go in a class with others,
Daddy?"</p>

<p>"Probably not&mdash;for it is a small school. Besides,
I can arrange for you to have private
lessons. It will hurry things up for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Daddy!... But later, I
want to go to a regular ground school, if you
will let me." Her tone was as eager as any
boy's, starting out on his life work. "And study
airplane construction, and wireless&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He smiled at her approvingly. What a girl!</p>

<p>"You are ambitious, my dear," he said, but
there was pride in his words. "I don't see why
not, though.... Only, not all at once. As your
Aunt Emily reminded you, you have the rest of
your life."</p>

<p>"I can't bear to fool!" she exclaimed, impatiently.
"Now that I have graduated, I want
to get somewhere."</p>

<p>"You're bound to&mdash;unless you fly in circles,"
he remarked, lightly.</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;oh, you know what I mean, Daddy!
And you do understand, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly. You don't expect to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
one of those independent girls who insist upon
earning their own living, do you, dear?"</p>

<p>"I don't know...." Somehow, she couldn't
explain. Nobody understood just what she
wanted except Ted Mackay, and that was because
he had the same sort of goal himself. Ted
Mackay! The memory of her father's command
hurt her. Must she really give up his friendship?
But why? She wanted to ask her father, but he
was looking off in the distance, apparently lost
in his own thoughts.</p>

<p>So she drove the remainder of the way in
silence, absorbed by her own dreams.</p>

<p>The field was outside of Spring City, covering
an area of thirty acres, and surrounded by the
white fence that was now being used so much
by airports. Three large hangars, containing
probably half a dozen planes, occupied one side
of the field, and, near the entrance was a large
building, evidently used as an office and school
for the theoretical part of the courses.</p>

<p>"You have been here before, Linda?" asked
her father, as the girl locked her car.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a couple of times. I feel almost at
home."</p>

<p>Scarcely were they inside the grounds, when
Ted Mackay, looking huge and handsome in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
flyer's suit, came out of the office building. He
recognized Linda at once, and his blue eyes
lighted up in a smile of welcome. Since he wore
his helmet, his red hair was not visible, and
Linda, glancing apprehensively at her father,
knew that the latter had no idea who Ted was.
But, nervous as she was over the meeting that
was about to take place, she could not help feeling
proud of Ted, and warmed by the frankness
of his happy smile.</p>

<p>"Linda!" he cried. (She had called him Ted
the second time she met him, so he reciprocated.)
"I owe you an apology&mdash;and a confession!"</p>

<p>"Yes?" replied Linda, glancing fearfully at
her father, though she knew that he had not yet
realized who the young man was, or his expression
would not have been so beneficent. "But
first I want you to meet my father," she said.
"Dad&mdash;this is Ted Mackay."</p>

<p>She was vexed at herself that she was actually
stammering. Acting just like a child! Yet she
couldn't forget how stern her father could be.
She recalled the day that, as a child, she had
sneaked off and played with Louise when her
chum had whooping cough. Her father happened
to come home&mdash;and announced that he
would take care of her punishment. And what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
punishment! For three whole weeks he made
her stay in the house, without a single companion
except her Aunt Emily! He said he'd
teach her to obey.</p>

<p>But he wasn't storming, or even frowning
now. Merely looking politely indifferent, perhaps
a trifle superior. He made no motion to
shake hands with Ted.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" he said. "Would you be
kind enough to take us to the man in charge of
this field?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," replied Ted.</p>

<p>Immediately, as if he intended to give the
young people no chance for personal conversation,
Mr. Carlton began to ask about the courses
that were offered.</p>

<p>Ted answered his questions, explaining that
Miss Carlton would probably want to become a
private pilot at first.</p>

<p>"You have to pass a physical examination,"
he said, "and get a permit from the Government.
Then you must have at least eighteen
hours of flying experience&mdash;ten with someone
else with you, eight of solo flying. There is a
written examination, too&mdash;all about the rules
and regulations that make up the laws of the
air. Of course there isn't a lot of traffic, like
with the driving of cars," he explained, smil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>ingly,
"but you'd be surprised at how many rules
there are!"</p>

<p>They had been crossing the field while he
talked, and they stopped now at the main building.
With a nod of dismissal that was curt, and
yet not quite rude, for a muttered, "Thank you,"
accompanied it, Mr. Carlton left Ted, and took
his daughter inside.</p>

<p>A middle-aged man, dressed in a khaki shirt
and breeches, was seated at a desk. He looked
up as they entered.</p>

<p>"My name is Carlton," began Linda's father,
"and this is my daughter. I have bought her a
plane, and I have come over to arrange about
some lessons in flying."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Kingsberry, a former Army officer,
asked them to be seated, and went over
about the same explanation that Ted had given,
saying that he would be delighted to register
Linda, provided that she passed the physical
examination.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is not so unusual now to have
girls as students?" inquired Mr. Carlton.</p>

<p>"Not for many of the schools," replied the
lieutenant. "But it just happens that we so far
have not enrolled any of the fair sex. Your
daughter will be the first. When does she wish
to start?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"As soon as possible," replied Mr. Carlton.</p>

<p>"Now!" Linda could not help adding.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see why not," agreed the lieutenant,
leniently. "At least Miss Carlton could
take the physical examination, because one of
our doctors is here now. And if she passes that,
Mackay can give her the first lesson."</p>

<p>Linda's expression of delight suddenly died
on her lips. For she glanced at her father, and
saw the queer, drawn look about his mouth at
the mention of Ted's name.</p>

<p>"This&mdash;Mackay&mdash;" he said slowly, "he isn't
your only instructor?"</p>

<p>"He is our best."</p>

<p>"I prefer someone else. Can you arrange it?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I suppose so. But if it is only personal
reasons, I think you are making a mistake,
Mr. Carlton. Mackay is our most reliable flyer&mdash;by
far our best instructor. We don't expect to
have him here more than a month or so. He's
had a good offer from a big company."</p>

<p>Linda was glancing shyly, pleadingly, at her
father, but he did not even see her.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I found this young man's
father to be most unreliable&mdash;untrustworthy&mdash;during
the period that I employed him on my
ranch. The fact is, we are not yet through with
the trouble that he started. So you can under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>stand
why I should refuse to trust my daughter
to his son. It is an unpleasant but true fact that
children inherit their father's weaknesses. I
should not have a comfortable minute, being
miles away, and knowing that she was in his
hands."</p>

<p>"Of coarse I will accept your decision, Mr.
Carlton," replied Lieutenant Kingsberry, "and
see that your wishes are carried out. I will
summon the second ranking instructor&mdash;H. B.
Taylor."</p>

<p>He called his office boy, a young man learning
to fly, and working his way at the same time,
and gave the necessary message. A couple of
minutes later the man came in, dressed like Ted,
but somehow he seemed insignificant to Linda&mdash;as
if he were the one who was not reliable. She
sighed.</p>

<p>Her father remained with the lieutenant and
the instructor while she went into the doctor's
office for her physical examination. She knew
that her eyesight was good, but she felt a little
nervous when the doctor examined her heart. It
was fluttering so! Suppose all the excitement
had been too much for her&mdash;and she did not
pass! What good would her lovely plane be to
her, if she were never allowed to pilot it herself?</p>

<p>But she need not have been alarmed, for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
came through with flying colors. Then young
Taylor took her over to one of the planes, and
began to explain about the joystick, the rudder,
the ailerons, and everything else he could think
of, in words of one syllable.</p>

<p>Linda glanced at him, frowning. Did he think
she was a baby. Or was it because she was a girl
that his manner seemed so superior, so condescending?
Why, he was wasting a lot of time!
Ted would have had her up in the air by this
time, perhaps letting her guide the plane herself.</p>

<p>"I am familiar with all these terms, Mr. Taylor,"
she interrupted. "You see I have been up
twice&mdash;with Mr. Mackay. And I've read a couple
of books."</p>

<p>The young man regarded her haughtily.</p>

<p>"It is necessary, Miss Carlton, that you go
through the regular lessons, regardless of what
you knew beforehand," he answered coldly.
"And whatever Mr. Mackay may have shown
you&mdash;as a friend&mdash;has nothing to do with these
lessons, so long as I, not he, am your instructor."</p>

<p>"But I want to go up today!" she protested,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"It is not our custom to take students up on
the first day, Miss Carlton.... Now, have you
a notebook and pencil?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"In my car." She tried to answer naturally,
but she was keenly disappointed.</p>

<p>"Then will you please go and get them," he
said, seating himself in the cockpit of the plane
which he had been using to illustrate his statements.</p>

<p>Obediently, but half-heartedly, Linda started
back for the road where her car was parked. She
had gone about half-way when she came upon
her father, accompanied by Ralph Clavering,
dressed like herself, in his riding outfit.</p>

<p>"Hello, Linda!" he cried. "Passed your physical
exam, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered. "So you're really
going to learn, too?"</p>

<p>"I most certainly am. And your father has
consented to let us take our lessons together.
Won't that be fun?"</p>

<p>"Linda," interrupted her father, as he saw
her start away, "where are you going? I want
to tell you something."</p>

<p>"Yes, Daddy?" A wild hope surged in her
heart that perhaps he had changed his mind
about Ted. It wasn't only that she had taken a
dislike to H. B. Taylor&mdash;it was rather that she
had not confidence in him as a teacher. He might
be all right as a pilot, but instructing others was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
a different matter. And he would never really
feel any personal interest in her progress, or
understand her, like Ted. His attitude almost
said that he thought it was silly of girls to
want to fly!</p>

<p>But she ought to have known her father better
than to think he would change his mind.</p>

<p>"I should like to take your car and go home
now, if you don't mind," he said, "because I
have some work to do today that is urgent&mdash;some
people to see about business. And Mr.
Clavering has very kindly offered to drive you
home. Is that all right? I know you don't like
other people to run your car&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddy, you're different," she said,
forcing a smile. "Of course I don't mind your
driving it.... But I'm sorry you can't wait
for us."</p>

<p>Promising to meet Ralph in a couple of minutes,
she walked out to the entrance of the field
with her father.</p>

<p>"I need not tell you, dear," he said, "that
my decision about Mackay is final. And I want
you to have as little to do with him as possible,
while you are here. It's for your own good,
daughter. I can see that girls might find the
young man attractive. But it is well to steer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
clear of such people. Have all the fun you like
with your own friends."</p>

<p>"Yes, Daddy," she managed to reply.</p>

<p>"I guess young Clavering will see to it that
your time at home, after most of the others go
away for the summer, is not dull. And if you
pass your course and get your license, you can
fly your plane to Green Falls. I will make
arrangements about a place to keep it. I dare
say they have maps at the school."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and thank you so much&mdash;for everything,
Daddy," she said. She mustn't let him
see that she was disappointed, after all he had
done for her! He might be right about Ted&mdash;but
she didn't think so. Whatever Ted's father
might be, she felt sure that Ted was one of the
finest young Americans that she had ever
known.</p>

<p>Securing her notebook, and handing over her
keys to her father, she hurried back to the field,
and finished her lesson with Ralph at her side.
As they walked out together, she looked about
shyly for Ted. It wouldn't do any harm for her
just to speak to him; after all he did want to
tell her something. At last she spotted him,
across the field beside one of the planes&mdash;in
overalls and jumper now, his red hair brilliant
in the sunlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know I believe that's the fellow we
chased last night!" exclaimed Ralph. "Do you
know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've met him. He took me up a couple
of times."</p>

<p>"You know him? Then why was he sneaking
around so funny last night? Why didn't he
come over and speak to you?"</p>

<p>"He's shy," replied Linda, jumping to the
only conclusion that seemed feasible, and her
explanation must have been correct, for Ted
never looked up from his work as the young
couple passed.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_VI" id="Chapter_VI"><span class="smcap">Chapter VI</span></a><br />
<small><i>Winning Her License</i></small></h2>


<p>The next few weeks were the most interesting,
the most exciting, of Linda's whole life.
Every day she drove over to the Flying School
with Ralph, and gained first her theoretical,
and then her practical knowledge.</p>

<p>Both she and Ralph were surprised to find
that it was so simple a matter to handle a plane.
By the middle of July they were accustomed to
stepping into the cockpits by themselves, nosing
their planes into the wind, and rising to a
height of fifteen hundred feet, without even a
tremor. Anxiously they counted their hours of
solo flying, not only that their licenses would
be approved, but because they both wanted to
try some stunts. They had studied the principles
of loops, Immelman turns, barrel rolls,
and falling leaves, and they were wild to try
them out for themselves.</p>

<p>Finally, after they had both passed their
written examinations, and were only waiting for
their licenses to come through, Mr. Taylor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
allowed them both to try an inside loop and an
Immelman turn. Linda's happiness was so great
that she felt she just had to tell somebody, so
she went home and wrote to her father. Unfortunately,
she thought it wiser to say nothing
about stunts to her aunt.</p>

<p>Miss Carlton still insisted that she would
never get into a plane, not even Linda's. "It's
too dangerous," she objected, when her niece
was begging her to go for a ride. "I might be
killed&mdash;and then who would take care of you?
And besides, I don't see how anybody could
learn to fly in the short time you've been at it."</p>

<p>"But Aunt Emily," explained Linda patiently,
"it really is easier than driving a car.
Once you are off the ground, the plane practically
flies itself. And the higher you are, the
safer."</p>

<p>Miss Carlton shuddered.</p>

<p>"I can't believe that, dear. Because the
higher you are, the farther you have to fall!"</p>

<p>"But you have all that chance to regain
control of your plane," insisted her niece.
"Crashes practically always come on the
ground&mdash;it's very rare indeed that two planes
crash in the air, even when they are flying in
Army formation."</p>

<p>"How soon do you think you'll get your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
license?" inquired Miss Carlton, showing that
Linda's words had made no impression at all
upon her. She was anxious to get away now;
Spring City was becoming very hot.</p>

<p>"Any time now," replied the girl, her eyes
shining with anticipation. "I have done all the
required solo flying&mdash;and more too."</p>

<p>"Solo flying? Do you mean you've been up
alone? Without even Ralph?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course! And I love it, Aunt Emily!
Oh, if you could just try it once, you'd never
be afraid again. It is the most wonderful sensation&mdash;up
in the skies, all alone! Free as a
bird!" She paused abruptly, smiling at her
own enthusiasm. She did not often talk like this
to anybody, though there was a great deal of
poetry in her make-up.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, I'm glad you like it," said Miss
Carlton, in a matter-of-fact tone. "But don't
overdo it. And don't go in for any stunts."</p>

<p>Ralph Clavering, who had been making it his
habit to come over to see Linda every evening,
now that all his other friends had gone away,
arrived on the porch in time to hear Miss Carlton's
admonition. He was about to say something,
for he was very proud of his successful
"acrobatic flying," when he caught Linda's
frown of warning. Of course there was no use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of worrying the timid woman, who was worried
enough already.</p>

<p>He sat on the railing, dangling his legs, and
carelessly lighting a cigarette, as if he were
very much at home.</p>

<p>"Linda's little 'Pursuit' is a daisy, Miss
Carlton," he said. "It really has a most marvelous
motor&mdash;and all sorts of safety devices.
There's not a thing for you to worry about....
I wish I had one like it!"</p>

<p>Linda regarded him sympathetically. It was
hard luck that his father, with all his money,
refused to buy Ralph a plane! But he had been
promised one the following year&mdash;if he graduated
from college without any conditions.
Evidently Mr. Clavering was using it as a spur
to his son's ambition, for Ralph had never been
keen about his studies. Good times came first
with him; besides, he argued, what was the use
of learning to make money, when his father
already had more than they could spend?</p>

<p>"What are you children going to do this
evening?" asked Miss Carlton, though it was
nine o'clock now, and there wouldn't be much
evening left, for Linda insisted upon going to
bed early.</p>

<p>"I'd like to map out our trip to Green Falls,"
the latter replied. "And then we could show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
our plan to Lieutenant Kingsberry, and see
where the airports are located along the way,
in case we have to land."</p>

<p>"Why not Taylor?" inquired Ralph, teasingly,
for he knew that Linda did not care
much about her instructor.</p>

<p>She gave the boy a withering look.</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;Redhead? He ought to know.
By the way, I never see you talking to him,
Linda!"</p>

<p>"I never get a chance. He's always busy, and
besides, you're usually with me. I guess he's too
shy to intrude."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she decided that she must have
one talk with Ted Mackay before she left the
school, to clear up matters that had never
been discussed. All during the next week she
watched for her opportunity, but it did not
come until her final day at the school&mdash;the day
when she received her license as a private pilot.</p>

<p>Wild with joy at her success, she asked where
Ted was, and ran over to the hangar where he
happened to be working. For once, Ralph was
not with her; he had not yet landed the plane
he had been flying.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mackay!" she cried joyously&mdash;she was
afraid to call him "Ted" now, for he seemed
like such a stranger. "I'm a real pilot! I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
fly my own plane now, wherever I want to go!"</p>

<p>The young man came over solemnly and shook
hands with her.</p>

<p>"May I be the first to congratulate you?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Not the first. Lieutenant Kingsberry has
done so already. But, of course, in a way he
doesn't count."</p>

<p>"And this is only your beginning, I know!"
he said, his blue eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.
"You're going to a ground school in the
fall&mdash;as we used to talk about&mdash;aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hope so." She hesitated, and looked
down at the ground, digging the toe of a dainty
slipper&mdash;entirely feminine, in spite of her
flyer's costume&mdash;into the dust. She felt shy, and
embarrassed; it was so hard to hurt Ted, and
yet she didn't dare disobey her father. "Ted,"
she said, finally, "could I have just one little
talk with you, to clear things up&mdash;before I go
away?"</p>

<p>"I've been longing for it," he confessed,
eagerly. "But I'd decided that you were
through with me, on account of my actions that
night you got your plane&mdash;when I sneaked over
to see it. One of the boys heard it roaring over
our heads, and ran out to see where it was
landing. So, when he came back with the news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
that it was in your field, I knew it must be
yours. When I went over to see it myself&mdash;I&mdash;I
was hoping you'd come out alone&mdash;and we
could gloat over it together! And then all that
crowd showed up, and your aunt too&mdash;I was
sure it was she&mdash;and I just lost my nerve and
ran. It looked pretty queer, I guess."</p>

<p>"No, only why didn't you come to the house
first?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"I was afraid the butler would say, 'Miss
Carlton is not at home'&mdash;the way the rich young
ladies' butlers always do in the novels."</p>

<p>"Only we haven't any butler," laughed
Linda.</p>

<p>"Well, you have a strict aunt&mdash;and a father
that's made of steel!"</p>

<p>"Don't!" cried the girl, in an offended tone.
"You mustn't say a word against my father, or
I never will talk to you. But that brings me to
what I wanted to say.... My father has no
time for you, on account of your father. It
seems that a man by the same name worked for
him on the ranch in Texas&mdash;and was untrustworthy.
Could that have been your father?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it was," admitted Ted, sadly.</p>

<p>"So you see why he selected Mr. Taylor to
teach me to fly...." Tears almost came into
her eyes, as she saw how sorrowful Ted was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
looking. "I think it's absurd, myself," she
admitted. "But I suppose Daddy means it for
the best.... I'm&mdash;not to be friends with you,
Ted.... And, oh, I'm so sorry!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry too, Linda," the boy said slowly.
"But somehow I never believed we could be
real friends. I'm not like you&mdash;I don't believe
in fairy stories."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that the poor young man, who has a
disgrace to live down, isn't likely to be friends
with the rich, beautiful girl&mdash;in real life....
So I guess it's good-by...." He held out his
hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'll at least see you again!" she
protested. "Tomorrow I'm going to fly my
plane over here and back&mdash;all by myself!"</p>

<p>"That's wonderful&mdash;I wish I could be here to
see you do it," he answered regretfully. "But unfortunately
I am leaving myself tomorrow. I'm
taking a job as salesman for a plane construction
company in Kansas City."</p>

<p>"Congratulations!" cried Linda, pleased at
his advancement. "Well, good luck&mdash;and good-by!"</p>

<p>"And, by the way," he added, "I want to
thank you for wearing my poor little flowers at
your class-day. I saw you&mdash;through the fence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
I was so glad they held the affair out-of-doors!"</p>

<p>"Then they were from you?" she asked,
ashamed that she had forgotten to thank him.
"I thought so, but I wasn't sure. I meant to
ask you. They were lovely."</p>

<p>"I am going to give you a card of my firm,"
said Ted, reaching into his pocket. "So that you
will know where I am, in case you need any
help with your Arrow.... You&mdash;you&mdash;don't
mind?"</p>

<p>"I'll be very thankful to have it," she reassured
him. "You know, Ted, I have an awful
lot of confidence in you!"</p>

<p>And, with a final pressure of her hand, he
turned to go, and she, looking about, saw Ralph
Clavering walking towards her.</p>

<p>"What's the big idea?" he asked her, when
he reached her side, and Ted had disappeared.
"Holding hands with Red?" His tone was
irritable.</p>

<p>"I was just saying good-by," she explained.
"He's leaving tomorrow for a job in Kansas
City."</p>

<p>"Flying?"</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll be flying away soon, too," he
added, more cheerfully. "I had a letter from
Kit this morning, and she wants us surely at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Green Falls for July thirty-first. It's the Midsummer
Ball, and the big event of the season&mdash;socially.
She told me to tell you and Miss Carlton
to be sure not to miss it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be ready by Saturday," replied
Linda. "Aunt Emily has been doing all the
shopping, so I hardly need to do anything....
By the way, did Kit give you any gossip about
the crowd?"</p>

<p>"Let me see," muttered Ralph, as he took her
arm possessively while they walked across the
field, in the hope that Ted Mackay would see
them. "She did have quite a bit to say&mdash;but it
was mostly about Maurry."</p>

<p>"Maurice Stetson? What's he been doing?"</p>

<p>"Rushing Kit, evidently. And she seems to
like it.... And she said Harry Smith has a
life-guard's job, and is spending all his spare
time with Lou."</p>

<p>"I haven't heard from Lou in ages," remarked
Linda. "But I guess it's partly my
fault. I haven't had time to answer her letters."
Then, changing the subject, as they came out
to the road where Linda's car was parked,
"You're going to fly up with me in the 'Pursuit,'
aren't you, Ralph?"</p>

<p>"Surest thing! We'll fly everywhere to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>gether&mdash;from
now on. Just like Mr. and Mrs.
Lindy!"</p>

<p>"Only we won't!" she answered abruptly,
laughing at him.</p>

<p>As they stepped up to the roadster, they
almost fell over a man who came out from a
shabby coupÃ© in front of theirs. He had evidently
been leaning over, fixing something.</p>

<p>"Want any help?" asked Ralph, though
Linda knew he hadn't the slightest idea of
giving any.</p>

<p>"No, thanks," muttered the man, without
looking up. "Engine trouble."</p>

<p>"Engine trouble!" repeated Linda, sympathetically.
Then, turning to Ralph. "Suppose
something like that should happen to us&mdash;on
the way to Green Falls!"</p>

<p>"Well, it won't!" replied Ralph reassuringly.
"The motor's just about perfect in that little
plane of yours! No&mdash;but I tell you what, Linda,
you better bring your gun along. That crazy
sister of mine expects me to bring her pearls
up for the Midsummer Ball!"</p>

<p>"Real pearls&mdash;at a summer resort!" cried
Linda, as she slipped the key into her lock, and
started her engine. "She's taking an awful
chance!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what I think. But of course they're
insured. And so long as she's succeeded in getting
Dad's permission, it's not my business to
stop her.... By the way, it's a fancy-dress
affair. What sort of costume will you wear?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I guess I'll leave it to Aunt
Emily."</p>

<p>But when she got back home, she forgot all
about pearls and dresses and mid-summer balls.
Nothing mattered to her, but the glorious fact
that at last she was a real flyer!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Chapter_VII" id="Chapter_VII"><span class="smcap">Chapter VII</span></a><br />
<small><i>The Flight to Green Falls</i></small></h2>


<p>The first thing that Linda thought of when
she opened her eyes the following morning was
the glorious fact that she was now a real pilot.
She could take her plane anywhere&mdash;to Green
Falls, to her father's ranch in Texas, wherever
she wanted to go&mdash;and nobody could stop her.
The freedom of the world and of the skies was
hers.</p>

<p>But she had no intention of taking it any
farther than the Spring City Flying School that
day. She would spend the morning there, watching
one of the licensed mechanics give it a
thorough inspection, in readiness for the flight
to Green Falls on the following day.</p>

<p>She wished that it might be Ted Mackay who
would go over the plane. She had such confidence
in his knowledge, his thoroughness. Besides,
it would be fun to spend the morning
with him, asking him questions, and talking
things over.</p>

<p>Naturally, that was impossible. When Linda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
reached the field she found that Ted already
had gone, and a number of changes had been
made. H. B. Taylor was now first-ranking instructor,
and the young man who had been acting
as office boy, or orderly, or whatever they
chose to call him, had passed his course and
was promoted to the rank of instructor. Another
man took his place&mdash;an older man this time, and
Linda thought probably it was the poor fellow
who had been having engine trouble with his
shabby coupÃ© the preceding day. Everything
seemed different, and Linda was somehow glad
that she was leaving. The place would never be
the same to her without Ted Mackay.</p>

<p>About noon she received the mechanic's O.K.
upon her plane, and flew home in time for lunch.
Her aunt had finished packing, and was as
excited as a child about going to Green Falls,
and again taking up their customary social life
among their friends.</p>

<p>"I have bought a new flying suit for you,
dear," she said to her niece, as the girl entered
the library. "Unwrap it and see how you like
it."</p>

<p>Linda eagerly unfastened the strings and
lifted out a pair of white flannel knickers, with
a jaunty blue sweater and helmet of knitted silk,
just the color of her eyes. The whole costume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
was charming, and a lovely change from the
dark riding breeches she had been using for
flying.</p>

<p>"It's perfect, Aunt Emily!" she cried, realizing
for the first time that she had never cared
for what she was now wearing. "And it was so
sweet of you to think of getting it for me!"</p>

<p>"I never could see why girls have to look
masculine," replied her aunt. "Of course I can
understand that skirts are impractical, but
they make these suits so pretty now-a-days. And
I want you to look nice the very first minute
you arrive at Green Falls. First impressions
are always so important and there is sure to be
a crowd there to greet you."</p>

<p>Linda was only too delighted to wear it the
next day, which dawned clear and warm for her
flight. Miss Carlton left early in the morning,
by train, so that she would be at Green Falls in
plenty of time to welcome the flyers.</p>

<p>Ralph came over for Linda about half-past
nine. Carrying their lunch, the young people
started on their first real adventure in the air.</p>

<p>The young man, too, wore a new suit of spotless
white flannel, and, as they walked, tall and
slender and straight, they made perhaps the
best-looking pair of flyers in America. But
neither was conscious of that; both were too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
much excited about their first trip in the air to
give even a passing thought to their appearances.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that you have the precious
necklace?" asked Linda, as they made their way
across the field in back of her house.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," answered Ralph. "I went to
the safe-deposit vault this morning to get it.
That was one reason why I didn't want to start
early. I had to wait for the bank to open."</p>

<p>"Kit would be horribly disappointed if we
didn't bring it," returned Linda. "I honestly
think she loves those pearls as much as I do my
'Pursuit'!"</p>

<p>"Queer taste," remarked the boy. "If I had
them, I'd sell them and buy a biplane!"</p>

<p>"Of course you would," said Linda approvingly.
"Even if you do insist upon talking baby-talk!"</p>

<p>"Baby-talk?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. 'Buy a biplane'&mdash;sounds like
'Bye, Bye, Baby,' doesn't it?"</p>

<p>Ralph smiled, but they both forgot immediately
what they were saying, for they were
beside the plane now, ready to start on their
flight. Linda was not at all nervous about the
journey, only thrilled and happy. She climbed
into the cockpit with the same assurance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
she entered her car, and her take-off was just
as easy, just as natural. It seemed now as if she
piloted the biplane by instinct; with the sureness
of a bird it rose into the air to a gradual
height of fifteen hundred feet. For she had
been cautioned again and again that there was
safety in height.</p>

<p>They flew along without any attempt at conversation,
for it was difficult to hear above the
roar of the motor. But Linda was so happy that
she hummed softly to herself, and most of the
time she was smiling. Ralph, with a map in his
lap, kept a close watch on the compass.</p>

<p>For some time they did not see any other
planes in the sky, and then at last one came into
view. As it drew closer, it occurred to Linda to
wonder whether she was being followed.</p>

<p>"Who do you suppose that is?" shouted
Ralph, above the noise of the motor.</p>

<p>"I think it's somebody from our school&mdash;maybe
Taylor," she replied. "Perhaps Dad
ordered them to follow us&mdash;for safety&mdash;or
maybe it was Ted Mackay's idea."</p>

<p>As the plane drifted off to one side, they
thought no more about the matter. But it was
noon now; the sun stood high overhead, and
both of the young people were astonished to
find how hungry they were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to try a couple of stunts before we
eat," Linda told Ralph. "You're game, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Surest thing!" replied the boy, with delight.
"We've got plenty of height&mdash;and a spectator
too, for that matter." The other plane
had just come back into sight.</p>

<p>Linda's eyes were shining with excitement,
yet inside she was perfectly cool. Hadn't she
made inside loops and Immelman turns often at
school, and didn't she know exactly what to do?
With perfect poise, she swung the plane into
a loop, and completed it without any difficulty.
Pleased with her success, she tried it again and
again.</p>

<p>"You must think you're Laura Ingalls!"
shouted Ralph, catching his breath. "Trying to
beat her record?"</p>

<p>"Hardly," smiled Linda, for the famous
aviatrix he mentioned held the record at that
time with nine hundred and eighty consecutive
inside loops, at a speed of four and a half loops
a minute.</p>

<p>The plane was righted now, but Linda suddenly
noticed that Ralph was acting awfully
queer, hanging over the side, and hunting
frantically in the pockets of the sweater which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
he had put over the seat. She believed he must
be ill; certainly his face was ghastly white.</p>

<p>"Ralph!" she cried, fearfully. "What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>"I've lost the necklace!" he screamed in
terror. "Must have fallen out of my pocket!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" wailed Linda, aghast at the meaning
of his words. "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Positive!"</p>

<p>"Then we'll land immediately. We're over a
field, so we ought to be able to find it. Now&mdash;keep
your eye on the compass!"</p>

<p>Gradually, and with easy skill, she turned the
biplane into the wind and descended, finally
coming down into a large flat field, evidently a
pasture ground for some horses. Ralph was the
first to jump out.</p>

<p>"We went a little south to land," he said,
"so it must have dropped up there."</p>

<p>"Was it in a box?" questioned Linda.</p>

<p>"Yes, fortunately. A white velvet box, inside
a larger pasteboard one, with three rubber
bands around it. That ought to make it easier
to find."</p>

<p>Linda, however, had her doubts; the field was
so big! Besides, what proof had Ralph that he
had lost it at that particular minute&mdash;when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
was making her loops. She remembered that he
had taken off his sweater an hour ago, when he
felt too warm, and had carelessly hung it over
the side, forgetful of the precious box in its
pocket. That was the trouble with being so rich!
Many times she had noticed how heedless both
Kitty and Ralph were about valuables.</p>

<p>They walked silently across the field, their
eyes on the ground, their minds filled with
remorse. Ten minutes passed, and they had not
found it.</p>

<p>"Let's go back and eat our lunch," suggested
Ralph, consulting his watch. "It's almost one
o'clock, and we'll feel better if we eat. After
all, we have plenty of time&mdash;Green Falls is only
about twenty miles farther. We could search all
afternoon, if necessary."</p>

<p>"Yes, only Aunt Emily would nearly die of
anxiety. She'd be sure we had been killed, if we
didn't arrive before supper."</p>

<p>They went back to the plane and took out the
dainty lunch which Miss Carlton's cook had
packed that morning for them. But, hungry
though they were, the meal was not the pleasant
picnic they had been hoping for. Both were too
unhappy to enjoy what they were eating.</p>

<p>Presently the noise of a motor overhead attracted
their attention, and, looking up, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
saw a plane in descent. When it was low enough
to identify, they knew that it was the one that
had been following them.</p>

<p>"It's the 'Waco' from our school!" cried
Linda. "I recognize it now. He must think we're
in trouble. I wonder who's piloting?"</p>

<p>The plane made a rather poor landing at the
far end of the field, perhaps half a mile away.
They could distinguish a man getting out of the
cockpit, but of course at that distance they
could not identify him. However, he seemed to
be coming slowly towards them.</p>

<p>As he advanced nearer and nearer Linda
noticed that he wore an ordinary suit of clothing&mdash;not
a flyer's uniform, and he kept his hand
in his pocket. But she still did not recognize
him&mdash;unless he was that new man the school
had taken on the preceding day. Once he stooped
over, as if he were picking something up, and
Linda's heart beat wildly with hope. Could it
be that he had found the necklace? Apparently,
though, it was only a plant that he had pulled
up by the roots, for when he straightened himself,
he seemed to be examining its leaves.</p>

<p>"In trouble?" he shouted, as soon as he was
within hearing distance.</p>

<p>Ralph jumped up and ran towards him, shaking
his head in the negative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"No trouble with the plane," he replied. "But
we've lost a little box&mdash;with a necklace in it.
You haven't seen it, have you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," answered the man slowly, "I
did pick up a box." And he put his other hand
in his pocket, and drew out the very article.
Fortunately it had not been broken; even the
rubber bands were still tightly around it. He
handed it to Ralph.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you a thousand times!" cried
Linda, too relieved to believe her eyes. "The
necklace was a graduation present to this man's
sister, and she values it very highly!"</p>

<p>"Well, if that's all, I'll be off," said the man,
as he watched Ralph put the box into his pocket.</p>

<p>"No, I must reward you," insisted the boy,
taking out a twenty-dollar bill. "And by the
way, you're from the Spring City Flying
School, aren't you? We recognized the plane."</p>

<p>The other nodded, and seemed in a hurry to
be off. Already he was twenty feet away.</p>

<p>"It was awfully nice of you to follow us, and
look after us," called Linda, "but really we
don't need protection. We're getting along
finely!"</p>

<p>But the man was running now, and could
hardly have heard what Linda was saying. In
a couple of minutes they heard the motor start,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and with a clumsy take-off, the plane ascended.</p>

<p>"A queer cuss," remarked Ralph. "And I
can't see that he's much of a flyer. You and I
are both better&mdash;by a long shot.... But anyhow,
we've got the necklace!" He put his arms
around Linda and hugged her, and she was too
happy to protest. What a miracle it was to have
found it!</p>

<p>"That will teach me a lesson," said Ralph,
as he helped Linda gather up the lunch. "I'm
going to be more careful now. I've put the necklace
in my most inside pocket!"</p>

<p>"And I'm not going in for any more acrobatics
for a while," added Linda.</p>

<p>They climbed into the cockpit, and started
the motor without wasting any more time. Half
an hour later they made a graceful landing at
Green Falls' Airport, for a group of a hundred
spectators to witness and admire.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_VIII" id="Chapter_VIII"><span class="smcap">Chapter VIII</span></a><br />
<small><i>The Robbery</i></small></h2>


<p>"Let's don't say anything about our little
mishap," whispered Linda, as the flying couple
got out of their plane. "For one thing, I'd just
as soon not boast about stunts in front of Aunt
Emily. She would be worried all the more."</p>

<p>"And I'm not any too proud of the fact that
I was so careless about a valuable necklace,"
returned Ralph. "So we'll keep it our secret."</p>

<p>There was no time for further words. Everybody
rushed at them, shouting joyous welcomes.
Louise was the first to kiss Linda&mdash;then all the
others, and finally her aunt.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven you're safe!" cried the latter.
"I couldn't eat a bite of lunch, I was so
uneasy."</p>

<p>"Of course we're safe," assured Ralph.
"And maybe if we'd come by motor, we should
have had an accident. There was a big smash-up&mdash;two
automobiles&mdash;outside of Spring City
this morning."</p>

<p>"Isn't the air up here wonderful!" exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Miss Carlton. "After that stuffy town of ours!"</p>

<p>"I think the <i>airport</i> is wonderful," replied
Linda, "for so small a place. But as for the
air&mdash;well, don't forget Auntie dear, that Ralph
and I have been having marvelous air&mdash;up in
the skies!"</p>

<p>"Hope you didn't give him the air," remarked
Maurice Stetson, solemnly.</p>

<p>Kitty Clavering gave the young man a
withering look, and inquired of the flyers when
they might hope for rides. "Oh, I don't mean
today," she added, "for I know you must both
be nearly dead."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!" denied Linda, who still
looked as fresh as a flower in her becoming blue
and white suit. "But it's supposed to be wise
to have a mechanic go over your plane each
time you fly. Just a precaution, you see."</p>

<p>"A very good rule to follow," commented
Miss Carlton. "Now everybody get into their
cars, and we'll go over to our bungalow for
some ginger-ale and sandwiches."</p>

<p>"Just a moment, please!" interrupted a
voice at her elbow, and everyone turned to see
a newspaper man with a camera. "Pictures,
please!"</p>

<p>Linda and Ralph smilingly agreed, and their
friends stepped aside. Then they all piled into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the three machines that were waiting for them;
while the strangers who had been watching
commented on the beautiful biplane, and the
handsome couple who had been flying it, and
wondered whether they were married.</p>

<p>"Did you bring my necklace, Ralph?" asked
Kitty Clavering, as he got into her roadster
with her and Maurice.</p>

<p>"Surest thing!" he replied, as if nothing at
all had happened on the way. Reaching into his
pocket, he pulled out the pasteboard box, with
the French jeweler's name engraved on the lid.</p>

<p>"Thanks a lot," she replied. "Maurry, you
take care of it till we get home, so long as you're
sitting in the middle. Mind you don't lose it!
I think as much of that as Linda does of her
plane."</p>

<p>"But not as much of it as you do of me?"
asked the youth, flippantly.</p>

<p>"A thousand times more! Like the old question
people always ask married men: 'If your
mother and your wife were drowning, which
one would you save?' Well, if you and the necklace
were drowning, I'd go after my necklace!"</p>

<p>"Righto. Necklaces, no matter how valuable,
have never been known to swim. I do."</p>

<p>It was only a five minute ride from the airport
to Miss Carlton's bungalow, so Kitty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
waited until they had all gone inside the pleasant
living-room to open her box, and gaze at her
beloved treasure once more.</p>

<p>"I'm dying to see it again," she said, as she
took the box from Maurice's hand. "If I had
my way, I wouldn't keep it in a safe-deposit
vault. I like it where I can look at it."</p>

<p>She took off the rubber bands and opened
the box, displaying the velvet case inside. But
when she unfastened the clasp, her expression
of delight changed abruptly to one of horror.
The case was empty!</p>

<p>Her exclamation of distress was pitiful to
hear. Her dearest possession&mdash;gone!</p>

<p>"Ralph!" she cried with torturing accusation.
"Ralph! Are you teasing me?"</p>

<p>Her brother's face became ghastly white.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what's wrong&mdash;Kit?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"My necklace! Oh, what has happened?" She
burst out crying.</p>

<p>Everybody crowded around and gazed in consternation
at the empty box, looking questioningly
at Ralph, to see whether it could possibly
be intended as a joke. But he did not need to
tell them of his innocence; he looked almost
as stricken as his sister. He knew now that it
had been stolen by the man who pretended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
be a pilot! And he had actually made twenty
dollars out of Ralph besides, for the transaction!
What fools they had been, never to open
the box!</p>

<p>"It's all my fault!" cried Linda, contritely.
"My silly, foolish, childishness, for wanting to
show off!"</p>

<p>Nobody of course had any idea what she was
talking about&mdash;nobody except Ralph.</p>

<p>"No! No! It was mine!" he protested. "My
carelessness!"</p>

<p>"Then you both knew!" exclaimed Kitty,
raising her head, which she had buried on
Linda's shoulder while she sobbed. "Oh, how
cruel, not to prepare me!"</p>

<p>"On my honor, we didn't!" averred Ralph,
and from the look on his face, his sister knew
that he was telling the truth.</p>

<p>"Explain what you meant, then," she commanded.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you," put in Linda. "But sit
down, Kit dear. You're liable to faint....
You see, we were robbed, and too foolish to
suspect it. We even paid the robber twenty
dollars for doing the job."</p>

<p>"So you said," Kitty remarked, impatiently.
"Do you mean that you saw somebody take it&mdash;right
under your eyes?" She had dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
down on the couch, and her pale little face was
pitiful to see. The tears still ran down her
cheeks, washing tiny rivers through the powder.
Luckily she was not a girl who used rouge,
or she would have looked ridiculous. As it
was, she gave the appearance of a very unhappy
child.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" explained Linda. "Or rather, we
might have, if we had had sense enough to
realize it. I wanted to try a couple of loops, and
we started quite high, but by the time we had
finished, we were over an open field. It was
then that Ralph suddenly realized that the box
had dropped out of his pocket when the plane
was on its side. So we decided to land, and
search the field."</p>

<p>"And somebody had already picked it up?"
demanded Dot, excitedly.</p>

<p>"No. Another airplane&mdash;I had noticed it before&mdash;landed
soon after we came down. The
pilot walked over and asked us if we were in
trouble."</p>

<p>"And you stupids told him all about the fifty-thousand-dollar
necklace!" cried Louise, in disgust.</p>

<p>"No, we didn't! We were smart enough to
know that wouldn't be wise. We thought we
knew him, though&mdash;we had seen him at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Spring City Flying School. But we did tell him
we had lost a necklace, and he said he had
picked something up. As a matter of fact, we
had noticed him stoop over."</p>

<p>"And you took it and thanked him, and never
looked inside!" cried Kitty.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you're right," admitted Ralph.
"We thought he was a friend, following us
for our protection, at the orders of the school."</p>

<p>"Well, then, why was he following you?"
demanded Kitty, incredulously.</p>

<p>"He must have overheard us talking about
the necklace," answered Linda slowly, for she
was trying to think the thing out. "Yes&mdash;that
is what I believe he was doing all the time,
Ralph. Now I remember&mdash;the day we got our
licenses!"</p>

<p>"You mean you went around the school
shouting the news that you were carrying
pearls to Green Falls in an airplane?" asked
the unhappy girl.</p>

<p>"Of course not! Only the men at the bank&mdash;the
safe-deposit vault&mdash;really knew about it.
And of course they're absolutely trustworthy!
Except maybe this one man&mdash;who was fixing his
car outside the aviation field. We never thought
he was listening&mdash;why we couldn't even see
him!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Children," interrupted Miss Carlton, who
had been patiently waiting to serve the refreshments,
"wouldn't you all feel better if
you ate something? Then we can discuss what
are the best steps to take to capture the thief."</p>

<p>They agreed, but Linda and Ralph and Kitty
were all extremely nervous; they hated to lose
any time. Ralph decided to telephone to a lawyer
at once in Spring City, to put expert detectives
on the job, and to get in touch with
the Flying School.</p>

<p>"Lucky the necklace was insured," remarked
Maurice Stetson, as he drank his ginger-ale.</p>

<p>"Yes, but Dad will never get me another!"
moaned Kitty, disconsolately. "He'll say I
was careless, and invest the insurance in bonds,
to be kept in trust till I'm older&mdash;or something
like that." She started to cry afresh. "And I
only wore the necklace twice&mdash;at graduation
and at the class dance!"</p>

<p>Linda watched her sorrow with more than
sympathy&mdash;with remorse. It was her fault, she
was sure! Of course she couldn't imagine caring
so much for a pearl necklace, when such
lovely imitations were made, but it wasn't her
place to judge. Kitty probably wouldn't understand
why she loved her Arrow so much.</p>

<p>Slowly, painfully, she came to her decision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
She rose and went over to the couch where
Kitty was sitting, and crowded in between the
latter and Dot.</p>

<p>"It's my fault, Kit," she said, "and of course
I can't pay for it&mdash;but I can help. I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;going
to sell my airplane, and&mdash;give you the
money. Then you can start buying a new one&mdash;a
couple of pearls at a time."</p>

<p>Kitty squeezed her hand affectionately.</p>

<p>"You're a dear, Linda, but I couldn't possibly
let you do that. Besides, it was really
Ralph's fault."</p>

<p>"Of course it was!" put in the young man,
returning from making his telephone call. "But
we're going to catch that thief!" he announced,
with conviction. "I've just been talking with
Lieutenant Kingsberry at the field, and he says
that fellow didn't even have a license, that
they only took him on temporarily, as sort of
errand boy. And he deliberately stole that
plane!"</p>

<p>"I thought he was about the poorest pilot
I ever saw!" cried Linda, jumping up excitedly
at this piece of news. "He'll probably crash,
sooner or later.... Ralph!" Her eyes were
shining with inspiration.... "Let's go out
after him&mdash;ourselves!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lieutenant Kingsberry is broadcasting the
news all over&mdash;to all the airports," replied the
young man. "Everybody will be watching for
him. Do you think there would be any use in
our going?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! We might be just the ones to
spot him! Oh, come on!"</p>

<p>"But haven't you had enough flying for today,
Linda?" inquired Miss Carlton, anxiously.</p>

<p>"We won't go far, Auntie dear," answered
the girl. "Just around to the nearest airports,
and see if anybody has any information. The
practice of landing and taking-off again will
be good for us both.... And you needn't
worry one bit!... Now, who'll drive us over
to our 'Pursuit'?"</p>

<p>"'Pursuit' is right," remarked Maurice.
"Your plane has the right name, Linda!"</p>

<p>Louise immediately offered her services, and
in less than five minutes the young pilots had
washed their faces and were ready to start.
Ten minutes later they climbed into the cockpit
on the runway of the airport, and, this time
with Ralph at the controls, they took off for
the nearest airport.</p>

<p>Ralph was delighted to be piloting a plane
again, and in his enthusiasm he almost for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>got
the seriousness of his mission. A king of
the air, he thought, and his lips were smiling.
But Linda could not forget so easily.</p>

<p>Like most young men, he loved going fast,
and as soon as he was high enough, he let
the plane out to her maximum speed. Over the
clouds they sailed, at a rate of seventy miles
an hour, yet they did not seem to be traveling
fast. Linda had no sense of danger, yet it was
the first flight she had ever made that she did
not thoroughly enjoy, for, unlike Ralph, she
could not for one moment forget Kitty's
tragedy.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes, however, was all that was
needed to reach their first port, and Ralph, not
quite so skilled or so careful as Linda, made,
nevertheless a pretty landing. It was a large
field, evidently designed for amateur sport
flyers, and there were a number of licensed mechanics
in readiness to greet new arrivals.</p>

<p>Ralph lost no time in telling his story to the
first man who came forward. Had they any
information so far? he inquired.</p>

<p>"Only of a wreck about fifteen miles away,"
replied the latter. "That may be your man&mdash;if,
as you say, he is not an experienced pilot."</p>

<p>"Can you give us directions?" put in Linda
excitedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the other, taking a map
from his pocket, and indicating the position of
the wreck. "We've already sent a doctor and
a nurse&mdash;and telephoned for an ambulance."
Marking the spot, he handed the map to Ralph.</p>

<p>Jumping into the plane at once, Linda took
control, for she felt surer of herself than of
her companion in an emergency. The boy was
so absent-minded, so likely to forget things in
his excitement.</p>

<p>Their destination was a field again, but not
a large one, this time, and already a small
crowd, gathered from passing automobiles, had
collected. Here landing was not so easy as in
the airports designed for that very purpose.
But the girl knew just what she was doing, and
she handled the situation with a dexterity that
would have brought credit to a far more experienced
pilot.</p>

<p>Over against an embankment, its wings
smashed to pieces, a plane was lying on its
side, mutely testifying to the truth of the mechanic's
statement.</p>

<p>"There's the wreck!" cried Ralph, as he
and Linda stepped on the ground. "Do you
think it's the Waco?"</p>

<p>Grabbing her companion's arm, Linda ran
forward eagerly. When they were within fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
yards of it, she knew that it was the very plane
they were seeking.</p>

<p>"It is! Oh, Ralph! Even the license number&mdash;so
I'm sure! Remember? Look! Do you suppose
that man was killed?"</p>

<p>"Would serve him right!" muttered the boy,
resentfully. "Stealing a necklace, and crashing
a plane that wasn't his! But let's go over and
have a peep at him&mdash;there's the ambulance."</p>

<p>The crowd, which was still gathering, although
the field was in an isolated spot, was
being held back by a policeman, for the ambulance
was ready to start. Ralph dashed forward,
anxious to get a look at the thief before
it departed.</p>

<p>"Not that we could claim the necklace now,"
he explained to Linda, whose arm he was holding,
"for we haven't any proofs of our ownership.
But at least we could warn the cop to
look out for it."</p>

<p>"Back! Back!" shouted the officer, for the
driver was tooting his horn.</p>

<p>"Oh, please wait a minute!" begged Linda.
"Please let me see the man who is inside!"</p>

<p>The policeman regarded the girl doubtfully,
but she was so eager in her pleading that he
thought perhaps she had a good reason. Perhaps
the man inside the ambulance meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
something to her; he decided to grant her request.</p>

<p>"Take a look, miss," he agreed. "But be
quick about it."</p>

<p>Stepping ahead of Ralph, Linda climbed upon
the back step of the car, and peered anxiously
into it, past the white-clad interne, to the unconscious
figure on the stretcher. Suddenly she
started violently, and clung to the door of the
ambulance for support. It was incredible, impossible!
Her knees shook, her hands fell to
her side, and she swayed backward in a faint.
In an instant Ralph's arms were around her;
he carried her out of the crowd.</p>

<p>The unconscious man in the ambulance was
none other than Ted Mackay!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Chapter_IX" id="Chapter_IX"><span class="smcap">Chapter IX</span></a><br />
<small><i>Suspicions</i></small></h2>


<p>Someone from the crowd handed Ralph a cup
filled with water, and before they had gone half
a dozen steps, Linda had recovered consciousness.
She dropped down to the ground and
stared questioningly about her.</p>

<p>"What was it, my dear?" asked Ralph
gently, as he held the water to her lips. "Was
the man hurt so horribly?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it wasn't that," replied Linda slowly,
remembering all that had happened. "It was
just&mdash;oh, Ralph! I hate to tell you!"</p>

<p>"Please tell me, Linda," he begged.</p>

<p>She looked about her for a moment. The
ambulance had gone, and the crowd, seeing
that the girl was all right, began to withdraw,
some to examine the shattered plane, others to
go back to their cars parked along the roadside.
There was nobody listening now, so she
decided to answer Ralph's question.</p>

<p>"It wasn't our thief at all," she said. "It
was&mdash;Ted Mackay."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ted Mackay?" he repeated, as if he could
not believe his ears.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then how do you explain it? That couldn't
have been Mackay we met on that field&mdash;Mackay
disguised, or anything?"</p>

<p>"No. He wasn't tall enough. And he had
black hair. Oh, Ralph, I'm sure of that!"</p>

<p>"Then how do you explain it?"</p>

<p>"I don't explain it," she said weakly.</p>

<p>He said nothing more, but he knew that she
was not only terribly disappointed in not being
able to trace the necklace, but that she was
entertaining grave doubts about Mackay's part
in the whole miserable affair. Were he and
this thief in partnership, playing a wicked
game, and had Ted hired the man because he
would not let them know his part in the robbery?</p>

<p>But there was no use talking about that now,
for Ralph realized that Linda was almost ready
to collapse. Drawing her arm through his, he
led her silently back to the Pursuit, and put
her into the cockpit, indicating that he would
pilot them back to Green Falls. Not a word did
she utter during the entire flight homeward;
she drooped listlessly back in her seat, with an
expression of disappointment and despair on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
her face. How she wished that she had not
come!</p>

<p>No one was waiting for them at the airport,
so they took a taxi to Miss Carlton's bungalow.
They found the latter on the porch, with only
Kitty and Maurice beside her.</p>

<p>"Any news?" demanded the girl, jumping
out of the hammock, and rushing down the
steps before the taxi had been stopped.</p>

<p>"Some news, yes," replied Linda, while
Ralph paid the driver. "But I'm afraid it
doesn't mean much. Ralph will tell you all
about it."</p>

<p>But the young man was not willing to tell
his story until he had asked Miss Carlton to
take care of Linda.</p>

<p>"She fainted at the field," he explained.
"The hot sun and the crowd, I expect." He
did not want to speak of Ted Mackay before
her, while she felt so ill. "So if you'll take
Linda up to her room, Miss Carlton, I'll tell
Kitty what I know&mdash;and tell you later."</p>

<p>The words aroused Linda's aunt immediately,
and she lost interest in the necklace temporarily.
What were a few pearls, anyway, in
comparison to her precious girl? She hurried
her off to bed, and Ralph turned to Kitty and
Maurice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"You see it was this way," he began, and
Kitty stamped her foot in exasperation.</p>

<p>"Don't be so slow, Ralph!" she commanded.</p>

<p>"Why, here comes Linda's father!" interrupted
Maurice, as another taxi stopped at
the bungalow. "What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>Kitty looked vexed. Another interruption!
But Ralph was already on his feet, greeting
him, and explaining the absence of Linda and
her aunt.</p>

<p>"And I was just going to tell Kitty about
our pursuit of the thief," he added, "so if you
care to hear the story, Mr. Carlton, perhaps
you will sit here with us?"</p>

<p>The older man was glad to comply with the
request. Naturally, anything that was connected
with Linda's first flights was of paramount
interest to him.</p>

<p>So, in spite of Kitty's impatience, her brother
began the story with the day that he and Linda
received their licenses, and ended it with the
latter's identification of Ted Mackay, unconscious
on the stretcher in the ambulance.</p>

<p>"Mackay!" repeated Mr. Carlton, shaking
his head knowingly. "So he was the brains of
the crime!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so, sir. And I'm afraid that's
what made Linda faint."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course it is! She believed in that fellow.
But I warned her not to trust him. You see
his father worked for me out in Texas and he's
an unprincipled fellow. Stole from everybody&mdash;not
only myself, but even the rest of the
help. And got into a mix-up with some Mexicans,
and turned them against me.... Yes, it
must run in the family. The father may even
be in on this necklace robbery. I don't know
where he is now."</p>

<p>"That explains a good deal," mused Ralph,
who had been listening thoughtfully. "I never
did like Ted Mackay." He would not admit
even to himself that jealousy was the main reason
for this dislike. "Besides, Linda probably
told him about the Midsummer Ball, and our
carrying Kit's necklace to Green Falls. I
thought it was funny if that other chap caught
on so quickly."</p>

<p>"Did Linda see much of Mackay while she
was at the school?" her father asked, sharply.</p>

<p>"I can't say that, although I wasn't always
with her. Towards the end of our time we did
so much solo flying, that when I was up in the
air I didn't know where she was, although she
was usually up too&mdash;in another plane. But one
time I did find her in a pretty intimate conver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>sation&mdash;and
that was right before we left. She
probably told him then."</p>

<p>"Too bad! Too bad!" muttered Mr. Carlton,
regretfully. He was wishing now that he had
sent Linda to some other flying school.</p>

<p>At this moment, Miss Carlton, having left
Linda asleep in her room, came out on the
porch to see her young guests. She showed no
surprise at finding her brother; for fifteen
years she had been accustomed to having him
drop in when least expected, without a moment's
notice.</p>

<p>"Well, Tom," was all that she said, as she
presented her cheek for his brotherly kiss. "I
suppose these children have told you the news."</p>

<p>"Yes, and if you don't mind, Emily, I think
I'll drive over with them to see Mr. Clavering,"
he added, for the young people had all risen,
and were showing signs of departure. "I'd
like to have a talk with him&mdash;at least if you'll
excuse me."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied his sister. "And will
you be back in time for dinner?"</p>

<p>"I'll come home in half an hour," stated her
brother, laughing, for he always teased her
about her insistence upon his promptness.</p>

<p>It was natural that he should want to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Kitty's parents, that he might at least offer
to do his part in trying to recover or make
good the girl's loss.</p>

<p>But Mr. Clavering seemed to take the matter
almost lightly.</p>

<p>"Of course it's too bad," he said, "but as
long as it is only a theft, and not an injury to
one of the children, I think it's foolish to worry.
And, after all, we may get insurance."</p>

<p>"<i>May</i> get insurance?" repeated Mr. Carlton,
frowning. "Why shouldn't you get it? I
thought that was what insurance was for!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid ordinary insurance will not cover
travel by air," explained the other man.</p>

<p>At these words his daughter burst into tears.
Her last hope was gone!</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," said Mr. Carlton,
gravely. "That makes a difference.... Well,
Mr. Clavering, in that case, I guess we had
better divide the obligation. I'll raise my
twenty-five thousand&mdash;the necklace was worth
fifty, I understand&mdash;as soon as I can."</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the sort!" protested
the other, firmly. "Your daughter was not the
least bit at fault. It was natural for her to try
her stunts&mdash;she wouldn't be human if she
didn't! I put the whole blame upon Ralph."</p>

<p>"No! No&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes! I won't hear anything else. But
we'll wait and give the detectives time. If we
have caught the leader, as you and Ralph think,
it ought to be an easy matter to locate the accomplice.
At least, provided Mackay doesn't
die."</p>

<p>"That's true!" exclaimed Ralph. "I never
thought of that. We better get over to the hospital
to see him as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"How about tomorrow morning?" suggested
Mr. Carlton. "I'd like to go with you, my boy&mdash;I've
had some experience in dealing with
criminals, ever since the episode with Mackay's
father."</p>

<p>"I'll be delighted to have you," replied
Ralph. "And in the meantime, I'll call my detective
and put him on the other man's trail."</p>

<p>So while Linda slept peacefully at home, her
father and her best boy friend made plans to
verify their suspicions against Ted Mackay,
lying helpless in the hospital, twenty-five miles
from Green Falls.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_X" id="Chapter_X"><span class="smcap">Chapter X</span></a><br />
<small><i>In the Hospital</i></small></h2>


<p>When Ted Mackay opened his eyes at the
hospital the following morning, he did not
know where he was. Although he had regained
consciousness when the orderlies brought him
in from the ambulance the day before, it had not
lasted long. An anesthetic was immediately administered,
for it was necessary to cut into his
arm, and later a drug was given to make him
sleep. So, for the moment, he could not understand
why he was here&mdash;in a ward, undoubtedly,
judging from the long row of cots against
the wall.</p>

<p>A dull aching pain in his arm and shoulder
made him glance suspiciously at his left side.
They were bandaged, of course. And then suddenly
he remembered.</p>

<p>He had been sent out with a new plane, from
his company in Kansas City, to make delivery
to a purchaser in Buffalo. Just before he left,
a radio message had been received from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Spring City Flying School, asking all pilots
and mechanics to look out for a stolen Waco.
Naturally, Ted remembered the plane.</p>

<p>He had been flying quite low, to make certain
tests with the plane he was delivering, over
the fields beyond Green Falls, when he suddenly
noticed a wreck. Complying with the regulations
of the Department of Commerce, he
descended in order to report the casualty and
to render assistance, if possible. Smashed as
it was, he recognized it immediately as the old
Waco, which he had so often piloted at Spring
City. He looked about for the pilot, dreading
to find his shattered body in the cockpit.</p>

<p>He had been leaning over, peering into the
bushes, when a gun went off at his back, hitting
him on the left arm, near the shoulder.
Reeling about sharply, he just had time to see
a shabbily dressed man run for the new plane.
And then everything went black; he couldn't
recall what happened, or how he got to the
hospital.</p>

<p>"The company's new plane!" he suddenly
exclaimed aloud, attempting to sit up in his
cot. "It's gone!"</p>

<p>He looked about helplessly for the nurse,
for anybody, to verify his fears. But nobody
came, although down the hall he could hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
footsteps of people busy on their early morning
duties.</p>

<p>Warned by the pain in his shoulder, he sank
back on his pillow to wait, and as he lay there
quietly, he went back over the events of the
past week that had been so eventful for him.
He thought of Linda Carlton, of the pride and
joy in her beautiful eyes when she had won
her license. And of her farewell! A farewell that
might easily be forever! Yet through no fault of
his own, merely because his father had disgraced
himself.</p>

<p>It had always been like that with Ted; it
seemed as if his father had tried to spoil his
whole life. Just when the boy was ready to
enter High School, Mr. Mackay had been dismissed
from his job for stealing from the cash-drawer
of the store where he was employed.
The judge had let him off, for he knew what
a splendid woman Mrs. Mackay was, and Ted
and his older sister had gone to work to pay
the debt. It was hard sledding after that; Mr.
Mackay wandered off, working now in one place
and now in another, and Ted put off his hopes
of study for a while. Then, just as the family
were getting ahead, and Ted had started in
at an aviation school, the man came back for
more money. The last they heard of him was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
a year ago, when he had written that he had
a real job on a ranch in Texas. But evidently
he had done something wrong there, or Mr.
Carlton would not be so bitter against his son.</p>

<p>Ted's shoulder was hurting him badly, and
his thoughts were not pleasant, so he uttered
a weary sigh.</p>

<p>"Well! Well!" exclaimed a cheery voice at
the door. "Is the world as sad as all that?"</p>

<p>Ted's mouth relaxed into a smile, the smile
that had won him so many friends at the Spring
City Flying School. He had not heard the nurse,
a pretty probationer, who just entered the
ward.</p>

<p>"How's the shoulder this morning?" she
asked him brightly. "You're looking better, Mr.
Mackay."</p>

<p>"I'm all right," replied Ted, wondering how
she knew his name. "But can you give me any
news of my plane?"</p>

<p>"Your plane was wrecked, wasn't it?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I hope not! That was the other fellow's
plane. The fellow that shot me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Then there were two planes?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Didn't you know?... You seem
to know my name&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There were some letters in your pocket&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>don't
you remember? And the address of a company
in Kansas City.... But I don't think
anybody realizes that there were <i>two</i> planes&mdash;that
you didn't wreck yours."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I wouldn't wreck a plane in that
way!" he protested. "I think too much of
them!" His face lighted up with the enthusiasm
he always showed when he talked about flying.
"But I've got to get to a telephone!" he added.
"I must notify my company immediately of
the loss."</p>

<p>"Probably your company knows all about
it," she replied. "Anyway, you can't do anything
now&mdash;except lie still while I take your
temperature. And then eat your breakfast.
After your wound is dressed&mdash;if the doctor
agrees&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I've got to get dressed right away! I
want to notify them so that they can catch that
bandit!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. In due time. You must be patient."</p>

<p>"You say they didn't know about that other
fellow!" he cried, excitedly. "I tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, for he saw that his
nurse had gone off to another cot. There was
no use trying to argue with nurses, he learned,
for they had to follow the rules laid down by
the doctors and the hospital authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>So, for the next two hours he did exactly as
he was told, not even making an attempt to
dress. For his nurse had informed him that he
must stay there at least another day.</p>

<p>He was dozing when a representative from
his company called to see him. But the man
urged the nurse not to disturb him, saying that
he would come again the following morning.
She told him what she knew of Ted's story,
and of his anxiety over the stolen plane, and
he promised to send out scouts in its pursuit.</p>

<p>Ted's next two visitors were not so thoughtful
of his welfare. Mr. Carlton and Ralph Clavering,
who made the trip unknown to Linda,
arrived about eleven o'clock, and asked that
the young man be awakened at once.</p>

<p>"I think you had better come back tomorrow,
if you want to talk to Mr. Mackay," said the
nurse, noticing that the two men were not any
too friendly towards her patient, for they had
not even inquired how he was. "He mustn't
be disturbed."</p>

<p>"Then we'll wait until he wakes up," replied
Mr. Carlton, firmly. "It's very important that
we speak with him as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"You're from his company?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, we're not."</p>

<p>"Just friends?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then may I ask what reason you have for
wishing to see Mr. Mackay at this particular
time?"</p>

<p>"Business. Very important business. We
think he is involved in the theft of a very expensive
necklace."</p>

<p>"No!" cried the nurse, aghast. It couldn't
be true! Why, she had never seen anybody with
franker eyes or a more truthful, honest face
than this young man with the wounded arm!
There must be some mistake.</p>

<p>"Did he act as if he wanted to get out of the
hospital as quickly as possible?" asked Ralph,
shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;but that was only natural. All
men, especially young men, are impatient about
staying here. Only last week, the day after a
man was operated on for appendicitis, he said
he had to get back to his office&mdash;he just had to!
You should have heard him rave. We laughed
at him."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll sit down here in the reception
room and read the magazines," announced Mr.
Carlton. "And you send us word when he
wakes up."</p>

<p>There was nothing further she could do, but
somehow she was against them. Already she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
was on Ted's side. She didn't believe he was
one of those wicked gangsters you read about
in the papers. Why, he was only a boy! A boy
tremendously interested in aviation. She could
see his eyes shine when he talked about flying,
and the absolute tragedy he believed it to be
because, a fine plane had been wrecked. It
seemed worse to him than being shot. Poor
fellow! He would get well, of course, but was
this going to cripple him so he wouldn't be
able to fly?</p>

<p>About twelve o'clock, when it was time for
the lunch trays to be brought in, he awakened.
But the nurse had no intention of informing
those two men in the waiting-room.</p>

<p>However, they did not wait to be informed.
Perhaps Mr. Carlton suspected that the nurse
was against him, or perhaps it was merely that
he knew that he hadn't much longer to stay&mdash;it
was imperative that he return to his ranch
that night. Anyway, he and Ralph strolled down
the hall and found Ted eating his lunch. They
walked right into the ward without asking the
nurse's permission.</p>

<p>"How d'do, Mackay," said Mr. Carlton,
briefly. "How's your wound?"</p>

<p>"Better, thank you, sir," replied Ted, smiling.
He had recognized Linda's father instantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
and a feeling of joy surged through him. What
a decent thing for the man to do! Probably
Linda had heard of his accident, and asked him
to come to inquire for him. Of course he was
totally unaware of the loss of the pearls; he had
no idea that the thief who had taken the two
planes had done so for the sole purpose of
stealing a necklace.</p>

<p>Remembering Ralph, too, he managed to
smile at him also.</p>

<p>"You certainly managed to wreck your
plane," remarked Mr. Carlton, not knowing exactly
how to begin. "You're in luck that you
weren't killed!"</p>

<p>"I didn't wreck <i>my</i> plane, sir," corrected
Ted, quietly. "It was the fellow who shot me
that wrecked his&mdash;or rather the school's, for
he had stolen it from the Spring City Flying
School, you know. Then he shot at me, and flew
off in my plane."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that so?" Mr. Carlton, raised his
brows, and his eyes narrowed. He didn't believe
a word of it.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;er&mdash;how did you and this thief happen
to be together?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I was taking a new plane to Buffalo, and
flying low, making some tests, when I spotted
the wreck. So I brought mine down."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"You knew, then, that he had stolen Miss
Clavering's pearls?"</p>

<p>"What?" cried Ted, starting upright in bed,
and then, shocked by the pain from his sudden
movement, dropping back to his pillow.</p>

<p>"You never heard of a valuable pearl necklace
that this young man was carrying from
Spring City to his sister, by my daughter's
plane?" persisted Mr. Carlton. His tone was
mocking, insulting.</p>

<p>"On my honor, Mr. Carlton&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come now, Mackay," interrupted Ralph.
"Why not make a clean breast of it? We know
you&mdash;or this other fellow&mdash;heard Linda and
me discussing it at the field, and we know you
used him as an accomplice. We saw him hanging
around outside&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are making a big mistake, Mackay,"
put in Mr. Carlton, "if you don't confess everything
now. I'd be willing to give you another
chance&mdash;if you tell us how you can get a hold of
that fellow, and get the necklace back. I know
you weren't brought up right&mdash;it's not exactly
your fault if you don't know right from
wrong&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But this was too much for Ted to bear. The
man was insulting his mother! If he hadn't
been Linda's father, Ted would have struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
him, crippled though he was. Instead, overpowered
by nervous exhaustion, he let out a
terrific scream that at least stopped the abuse.</p>

<p>"I do know right from wrong!" he cried.
"My mother is the finest woman that ever lived,
and she knew what to teach her children! What
you say is a lie!"</p>

<p>By this time everybody in the ward was
looking and listening in breathless interest, and
the head nurse, attracted by the noise, stopped
in the corridor.</p>

<p>"You men will leave at once," she commanded,
from the doorway, and Mr. Carlton,
who was so used to giving orders to others,
found that for once he had to obey. He and
Ralph picked up their hats and were gone without
another word.</p>

<p>After that, Ted was quite ill. His temperature
went up, and he became delirious. The
little nurse was both angry and remorseful. It
was her fault, she thought, for not keeping
those dreadful men out. Accusing an innocent
boy like her patient!</p>

<p>The visitors, however, went away dismayed.
They hadn't proved a thing.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I have to leave tonight right
after dinner," said Mr. Carlton, as Ralph drove
him back to his sister's. "I guess we'll have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
turn the whole thing over to the detectives."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see what Greer and his men can
do," replied the other. "One good thing, Mackay
can't get away from us, crippled as he is.
And the other fellow is such a poor pilot that
he'll crash sooner or later."</p>

<p>"If he doesn't get out of the country first,"
muttered Mr. Carlton, dolefully.</p>

<p>"What does Linda think about the affair?"
inquired Ralph, for he had not seen the girl
since her aunt helped her to go to bed the preceding
afternoon.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I haven't seen her. She was
still asleep when I left this morning."</p>

<p>"I imagine she believes Mackay guilty.
That's what knocked her over so yesterday."</p>

<p>"Well, she'll get over that," returned her
father, briefly. And he invited Ralph to come
into the house for luncheon.</p>

<p>The young man, however, had the good taste
to decline. It would be a ticklish situation at
best&mdash;and besides, Linda ought to have some
time to be alone with her father, if he were
leaving so soon.</p>

<p>"But tell Linda I'll be over after dinner,"
he added. "The bunch is planning a canoe
party."</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XI" id="Chapter_XI"><span class="smcap">Chapter XI</span></a><br />
<small><i>An Anxious Day for Linda</i></small></h2>


<p>Never in her life did Linda remember being
so exhausted as she had been on the evening
of her flight to Green Falls. With her Aunt
Emily's help she had somehow gotten into bed,
and eaten the supper of milk-toast which the
maid had brought to her.</p>

<p>Inside of an hour she was fast asleep, not
to awaken until eleven o'clock the following
morning, although her aunt, still a little worried
about her fainting, was in and out of her
room three times. It was upon the last occasion
that she finally opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, such a good sleep, Aunt Emily!" she
murmured, contentedly.</p>

<p>"Do you feel better, dear?" inquired the
other.</p>

<p>"Just fine, thanks. And hungry."</p>

<p>"I'll have Anna bring you up some fruit,
and then you can have lunch with us. Or would
you rather have a regular breakfast in bed?"</p>

<p>"Just the fruit, please, Aunt Emily," re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>plied
Linda. How kind, how thoughtful, her
aunt always was! No real mother could ever
be more so. "You are so good to me, Auntie!"
she cried, impulsively catching the older woman's
hand.</p>

<p>"And you're always so appreciative, dear,"
responded her aunt, affectionately. "I don't
think most young girls are like you. They just
expect their parents to do everything. Older
people like thanks."</p>

<p>"I guess everybody likes to be thanked, when
they deserve it...." She jumped out of bed,
and slipped into a chiffon negligee that hung
over the chair. "And now I'll hurry with my
bath!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear&mdash;because your father arrived yesterday,
after you had gone to bed. He'll be
here for lunch, but he has to leave right after
supper."</p>

<p>"Is he downstairs now?" asked Linda, excitedly.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether he has come in or not.
He went somewhere with Ralph this morning."</p>

<p>"With Ralph?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Something about the theft, I believe....
Well, dear, I'll send up some raspberries&mdash;or
would you rather have cantaloupe?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cantaloupe, I think, Aunt Emily," replied
Linda, as Miss Carlton left the room.</p>

<p>Some of the happiness with which Linda
awoke seemed to vanish at her aunt's statement
about her father and Ralph. She had forgotten
for the moment about the necklace&mdash;that airplane
accident, and the shock of finding Ted
Mackay. What could it all mean? Was Ted
really involved in the affair?</p>

<p>By this time her father must know about
him, since her Aunt Emily said he was with
Ralph. What were they up to now? If Ted
really were in league with the thief, would
they put him in prison too? She hated the
thought of such a thing&mdash;it did not seem possible.
Surely, there must be some explanation.
All of a sudden she longed fiercely to see the
boy, to hear the story from his own lips. But
he was in a hospital, unconscious&mdash;perhaps
dying!</p>

<p>Anna came in with the cantaloupe as Linda
finished her bath, and she sat on the edge of
the bed to eat it. She made a pretty picture,
her soft curly hair damp from the water, her
cheeks pink with color after the cold shower,
her charming blue negligee wrapped about her
slender figure. She looked like a lady of leisure
enjoying her late breakfast as if it were a regu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>lar
thing; not an aviation student who arose
every morning at seven o'clock and put in a
hard day's work at school.</p>

<p>When she entered the living-room, she found
her father there waiting for her. She was all
in white now, white linen sports suit, and white
shoes. He held out his arms invitingly, and she
leaped gracefully into his lap.</p>

<p>"Daddy dear!"</p>

<p>"Linda!"</p>

<p>"You didn't mind my not waking up for
supper last night, did you?" she asked, after
she had kissed him. "I would have been too
tired to talk."</p>

<p>"Of course not! It was the wisest thing to
do. Sometimes when you force yourself to keep
awake after a strain like that, you find you
cannot go to sleep again. But you're rested
now?"</p>

<p>"Fresh as a freshman," she replied, laughing.</p>

<p>"And I'm mighty proud of my little girl,"
he added, affectionately, "for passing your
examination and flying all the way up here
without any mishaps."</p>

<p>Linda's face grew sober, and her eyelids
fluttered.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I didn't, Daddy. You&mdash;you heard
about the necklace?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. That was too bad, but I can't see that
it was in any way your fault. You'd be a queer
flyer if you didn't want to test your knowledge."</p>

<p>"Then you don't really blame me?" she
asked eagerly. Her father's approval had always
meant so much to her.</p>

<p>"Of course not. It was the boy's carelessness.
He agrees with me, and so do his father and
mother. I went over to see them last night."</p>

<p>"Ralph hasn't heard anything more, has
he?" she asked anxiously. How she longed for
news of Ted! But she was afraid to mention
his name to her father.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlton, however, answered her unspoken
wish.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "We drove over to see Mackay
at the hospital this morning, and tried to
talk to him. But he wouldn't admit a thing. He
became hysterical when we accused him, and
the nurse had to ask us to go away. We're as
much in the dark as ever."</p>

<p>Linda got up quietly and went over to a
chair. Somehow she wouldn't sit on her father's
lap when he held such widely different
opinions from her own. But Mr. Carlton did
not seem to notice that she had gone. He sat
perfectly still, thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"You really believe Ted&mdash;Mr. Mackay&mdash;had
a part in the horrible thing?" she asked, dismally.</p>

<p>"I don't think there is a doubt of it."</p>

<p>"But how do you explain the fact that he
was shot? Surely, if he and this thief were
working together, one wouldn't shoot the
other!"</p>

<p>Her father shook his head, and smiled indulgently.
What a child she was! What did she
know about the wickedness of criminals?</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to tell you, dear, that in spite
of that old proverb about there being honor
among thieves, there isn't much. They are so
utterly selfish and unprincipled that if one finds
that his pal is getting the better of him, he
doesn't hesitate to wound&mdash;and oftentimes kill&mdash;the
other. If Mackay was making off with the
necklace, and this other fellow saw that all
his work had been for nothing, one could hardly
blame him for shooting.... No, I'm afraid
that doesn't prove a thing."</p>

<p>Linda sighed; everything seemed hopelessly
black for Ted.</p>

<p>"Will they put him in jail?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Whom?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Mackay."</p>

<p>"Of course, when he is well enough. Our de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>tectives
will see to that. We can't actually convict
him till we have more evidence. But we can
force him to tell what he knows about this
other thief."</p>

<p>A lump came into Linda's throat, and she
felt as if she couldn't talk any more. For the
time being, even her interest in her plane was
gone. It had brought so much unhappiness&mdash;first
to Kitty, and now to Ted Mackay.</p>

<p>She was thankful when her aunt came into
the room, to take her mind from her morbid
thoughts. At the same time, Anna announced
luncheon.</p>

<p>"What are you planning to do this afternoon,
dear?" inquired her Aunt Emily, as she
ate her iced fruit-cup. "Because I want part
of your time."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Aunt Emily. But tell me, have
you decided you would like to go up in the
Pursuit?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;nothing like that. I want to live a
little while longer, dear&mdash;Green Falls is so
pleasant! But, seriously," she added, "I do
want you to do something for me. I want you
to try on your costume for the Midsummer
Ball. I had to order it without asking you, dear,
for of course you were too busy learning to
fly, and it hadn't come when we left Spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
City. But I think it is very charming&mdash;and I
hope you will like it."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I shall. But, Aunt Emily, I could
have worn my flyer's suit, and saved you all
that trouble."</p>

<p>"You're going to get tired enough of that
suit, attractive though it is. Besides, everybody
would know you. And I like you to look especially
pretty&mdash;in fluffy, feminine things. I have
chosen the costume of Queen Mab for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be adorable!" cried Linda,
her eyes sparkling with pleasure, for she too
loved dainty things.</p>

<p>"And may I see you when you are trying it
on?" put in Mr. Carlton "Your mother once
wore something like that in a fairy play&mdash;and
she was very beautiful. I'd like to see whether
you remind me of her."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Daddy. I'll put it on right after
lunch. And then I'll do whatever you want.
Take you up for a ride, if you would like it."</p>

<p>"I think you're too tired for that," he replied.
"No&mdash;I'll wait till the next time I come.
Besides, the mechanics ought to have a chance
to go over your motor before you fly it again.
Don't forget the promises you made to me."</p>

<p>"I won't forget, Daddy. I'll telephone over
to the airport this afternoon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"By the way, daughter, have you ever tried
jumping with a parachute? Did they make
you do that at school?"</p>

<p>At his question, Miss Carlton suddenly
stopped eating and gazed at the girl in terror.
Surely Linda would not do such a hazardous
thing as that!</p>

<p>"Yes, Daddy," replied Linda, blushing, for
she did not want to say anything about her
jump with Ted Mackay. "Lieutenant Kingsberry
himself was with me. Mr. Taylor didn't
want to let me try it&mdash;I don't think he has much
use for girls who want to fly&mdash;so I went straight
to the Lieutenant. He went up with me himself."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it a dreadful experience?" asked
her aunt, with a shudder.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not terrible at all. I felt a little queer
before the parachute opened, but after that
it was delightful. Just softly floating down from
the skies. I loved it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you did it," remarked her
father. "Because now you won't be afraid if
you ever have to."</p>

<p>"I am hoping I won't have to&mdash;with my
Pursuit. Not that I'd be afraid, but because it
would be the end of my plane. Think of just
leaving it alone, to crash!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be too bad, of course&mdash;but I could
buy you another plane. We couldn't buy another
daughter, could we, Emily?" he asked
his sister.</p>

<p>"Don't talk about it!" begged Miss Carlton,
miserably.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Linda. "Suppose Daddy
tells me what he would like to do this afternoon&mdash;after
I try on the costume."</p>

<p>"Sure you don't want to be with your young
friends?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I'll have all the rest of the summer for
them."</p>

<p>"Then let's go for a little drive in your
roadster. Out to some pretty road. And come
back in time to go swimming with your crowd."</p>

<p>"I'd love that, Daddy!" she exclaimed.
Then, turning to her aunt, "But is my car here,
Aunt Emily? Did Thomas bring it up all
right?"</p>

<p>It was strange indeed, that she had forgotten
to ask about it. Always before she had driven
it herself, while Thomas, the chauffeur took
charge of her aunt's limousine. This time he
had hired a friend to drive the other, and
brought hers himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, he drove it up yesterday," replied her
aunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>The hours that followed would have been very
pleasant for Linda, had she not felt underneath
her cheeriness, a growing anxiety about Ted
Mackay. After their little outing, she and her
father put on their bathing-suits and joined
the group at the lake. In the diving, the racing,
the polo game, Mr. Carlton proved a match for
the young people; indeed he was the ringleader
in suggesting tricks to the more daring members
of the crowd. Even Louise, who had always
stood somewhat in awe of him because
he was sterner than her own parents, had to
admit that he was a good sport.</p>

<p>Ralph, who had not counted upon seeing
Linda until evening, was delighted to find her
at the lake, and tried immediately to date her
as his partner for the canoe trip of the evening.
But Linda shyly refused, telling him that
her aunt was one of the chaperons, and the only
partner she was willing to have. She shrank
from the thought of talking to Ralph about
Ted, or the robbery; she decided not to see
him alone.</p>

<p>Early after supper Mr. Carlton departed in
a taxi, and Linda and her aunt drove over to
Louise's bungalow to join the group for the
canoe trip. There were a dozen young people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
besides themselves, and Mr. and Mrs. Haydock,
too. Six canoes had been chartered.</p>

<p>"Canoeing will seem kind of tame after flying,
I guess," remarked Dot Crowley, as the
young people walked over to the lake. "By the
way, how soon will you take me for a fly?"</p>

<p>"Anybody might take you for a fly," remarked
Maurice Stetson. "You buzz around
so!"</p>

<p>Linda smiled, but she answered Dot's question
immediately. Maybe the latter was as keen
about airplanes as she was herself! You never
could tell.</p>

<p>"In a few days," she said. "For the time
being I want to hold myself and my plane in
readiness to chase that thief&mdash;if we ever get
the chance!"</p>

<p>"You still worrying about those pearls?"
inquired Maurice, lightly.</p>

<p>"Naturally," answered Linda.</p>

<p>"Well, I command you to forget it. Kitty'll
soon get over it. Anybody as beautiful as Kit
is, doesn't need pearls. Besides, when she marries
me, I'll buy her a bigger string!"</p>

<p>"You mean <i>if</i>, not <i>when</i>, don't you?" countered
Kitty. But she was evidently in high
spirits again, thanks perhaps to the young man
who made no secret of this adoration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>There wasn't much opportunity for conversation,
however. Jim Valier had brought his mandolin,
and from the moment when the canoes
pushed off until they were tied at the opposite
side of the lake, where the young people made
a fire and toasted marshmallows, everybody
sang. Linda naturally joined in with the music,
but only with her lips. Her heart was still
heavy with the misfortune the preceding day
had brought.</p>

<p>On the way home she made up her mind to
telephone the hospital the following morning.
At least she could inquire about Ted&mdash;and maybe&mdash;oh,
how she hoped it would be possible&mdash;she
could speak with him, and hear from his
own lips the explanation of his connection with
the unfortunate robbery.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XII" id="Chapter_XII"><span class="smcap">Chapter XII</span></a><br />
<small><i>The Search for the Thief</i></small></h2>


<p>For the first time in her life, Linda Carlton
was thankful that her father was not at home.
He would object to her calling Ted at the hospital,
but now it was impossible to ask his permission.
Nevertheless, she was trembling when
she took off the receiver and gave the hospital's
number.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mackay left last night," the attendant
told her, "to go to his home. He was very much
better."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Linda, hopefully. That was
good news indeed. But she wanted to learn
more.</p>

<p>"Would it be possible for me to talk to his
nurse?" she inquired. "I really have something
important to ask."</p>

<p>The attendant hesitated; it was not their
custom to call nurses from their duties to answer
inquiries about their patients. But Linda's
voice was so eager that the man decided for
once to waive the rule.</p>

<p>"If you will hold the line a minute," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
said, "I will see whether she is busy. You don't
know which nurse it was?"</p>

<p>"No. Probably one of the ward nurses."</p>

<p>Linda was forced to wait several minutes,
but in the end she was rewarded. A cheerful
girl's voice informed her that its owner had
taken charge of Ted Mackay while he was at
the hospital.</p>

<p>"But are you a friend or an enemy of Mr.
Mackay, Miss&mdash;&mdash;?" she inquired, cautiously.
"Carlton is my name," answered Linda. "And
I am a friend."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear that. Mr. Mackay is such
a nice boy that it is a shame he has to have
enemies.... Now, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Tell me what you know of his story," replied
Linda. "You see I only know that he was
shot and that his enemies are trying to connect
him with a thief who stole a valuable necklace.
I know it can't be true. It just can't!" She was
talking rapidly, excitedly. "I knew if I could
see him he could explain everything. But he's
gone!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he went home last night. To his mother's.
But I can tell you the facts, for he told
me the whole story. He was piloting another
plane&mdash;for his company&mdash;and spotted a wreck.
It proved to be this thief, who evidently wasn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
hurt by the crash, and so shot Mr. Mackay and
made off in his new plane. It seems perfectly
simple to me. I don't see how anybody could
possibly accuse Mr. Mackay, when he was actually
wounded himself."</p>

<p>"How does his company feel about it?"
asked Linda.</p>

<p>"Same as we do. He is to go back to his job
in a day or two, as soon as he feels rested."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness!" cried Linda. "Then everything
is O.K. Oh, you can't know how
thankful I am! And so grateful to you!"</p>

<p>"You're entirely welcome," concluded the
young nurse, pleased to have been of some
help.</p>

<p>Linda began to sing as she replaced the receiver,
and she went out on the porch in search
of her aunt. She just had to tell somebody about
Ted's innocence, and the weight which had
been taken from her heart at the nurse's reassuring
words. Miss Carlton had not heard
any particulars about the story; indeed she
scarcely knew who Ted Mackay was. So, omitting
the parachute jump, Linda began at the
beginning and related everything she knew
about him, since that day last April when she
had met him at the Red Cross Fair, and he had
promised to take her up in an airplane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you don't think he's wicked, just because
his father is, do you, Aunt Emily?" she
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, of course not, dear. It wouldn't be fair
to jump to any such conclusion as that. Every
human being has a right to be judged on his
own merits&mdash;not his parents'."</p>

<p>"That's what I think," agreed Linda. "But
Daddy says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hello, everybody!" interrupted a gay
young voice from the hedge in front of the
bungalow, and, turning about, Linda saw Ralph
Clavering striding up the path.</p>

<p>"Hello!" she answered, trying to make her
voice cordial. Such a handsome boy, so charming&mdash;why
did he have to be so unfair to Ted?
Poor Ted, who had never had one-tenth of
Ralph's advantages!</p>

<p>"I've got news!" he cried, as he took the
steps two at a time, and swung into a chair.</p>

<p>"About the necklace?" demanded Miss Carlton,
immediately.</p>

<p>"Yes. From our detectives. They have spotted
a gas-station that sold a can of gasoline to
a red-headed fellow who said he wanted it for
an airplane."</p>

<p>"Really, Ralph!" exclaimed Linda, scornfully.
"You don't call that news, do you? There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
must be plenty of red-haired pilots in our part
of the country."</p>

<p>"I know. But that isn't all. This agent carried
the gas over in his car to a field where the plane
was waiting, and he says there was another
chap in it who answered the description of our
thief."</p>

<p>"Was the plane a Waco?" questioned Linda,
keenly.</p>

<p>"The fellow wasn't sure, but when Greer
described it, he thought it was."</p>

<p>"And is that all?" Miss Carlton's tone
showed disappointment.</p>

<p>"'Is that all?'" repeated Ralph, in amazement.
"Why, that's plenty!"</p>

<p>"I don't see how that will help you to catch
your thief," remarked the woman.</p>

<p>"But it will! Greer has telephoned the hospital,
and located Mackay today. If he really
has gone home, as he said, and hasn't run
away, he'll be put through a third degree that'll
make him tell where the thief is hiding. Because
he must be hiding. He couldn't go very far on
the gas in that plane, and all the airports and
gasoline stations have been warned to watch
out for him."</p>

<p>Linda's eyes were blazing with anger. How
could Ralph be so prejudiced, so cruel?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Ted doesn't know any more about that
thief than we do!" she protested, vehemently.
"I talked with his nurse this morning&mdash;and she
knew all about it. Ted met that thief by accident!"</p>

<p>"By accident is right," remarked Ralph,
with a scornful smile. "But never mind, Linda&mdash;don't
you worry about it any more. Let's
talk about the masque ball tonight. You're going
with me, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I certainly am not!" announced the girl,
haughtily. "I wouldn't go with anybody who
could be so unfair&mdash;&mdash;".</p>

<p>"Children!" interrupted Miss Carlton, distressed
at their inclination to quarrel. She had
been so happy about the friendship between
Ralph and Linda&mdash;it was eminently right!
When her niece did decide to get married&mdash;though
she hoped such an event was still far
off&mdash;she couldn't imagine any young man who
would suit her so well as Ralph Clavering. Such
family! Such social position! And plenty of
money! For Miss Carlton was always afraid
that sometime her brother might lose his. He
was so careless about it, he spent it so recklessly
upon both his sister and his daughter.
And, though the older woman had enough of
her own securely invested in bonds to take care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of her old age, she feared for Linda. Educated
as she had been at that expensive private
school, she was in no way trained to earn a
living. She did not dream that Linda would
be only too delighted to go into aviation as
if she were a boy on her own responsibility&mdash;like
Ted Mackay!</p>

<p>"If I admit I'm jealous of Redhead, and say
I'm sorry," conceded Ralph, "will you forgive
me and go to the dance with me tonight?"</p>

<p>His beautiful dark eyes were pleading, and
for a moment Linda almost weakened, thinking
of all their experiences together, and especially
that moment when they both had thought they
were so happy, in regaining the box that supposedly
held the necklace. But she remembered
Ted, and the cruel gruelling he would be subjected
to very soon, because of Ralph's suspicions,
and she closed her lips tightly.</p>

<p>"Not unless you promise to call off your detectives
from Ted Mackay," she pronounced,
firmly.</p>

<p>"But I can't do that&mdash;couldn't now, even if
I wanted to. It's too late."</p>

<p>"Then I'm not going to the party with you."</p>

<p>"But Linda, dear," put in Miss Carlton,
going towards the screen door in her embarrassment
at being a witness to the quarrel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
"it's too late to arrange to go with anybody
else. All the other girls already have their
partners!"</p>

<p>"I'll go with you, Auntie!" replied the girl,
complacently. "Lots of girls go with their
parents."</p>

<p>"Very well," agreed her aunt, disappearing
into the living-room, with the unpleasant
thought that it was only the unpopular girls
who were forced into such a situation.</p>

<p>As soon as she had gone, Ralph came over
to Linda's chair. But he was afraid to touch
even her hand&mdash;she looked so aloof and determined.</p>

<p>"Linda&mdash;after all we've been to each
other&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>She stood up, holding her head high.</p>

<p>"I think you'll have to excuse me, Ralph,"
she said. "I'm very busy."</p>

<p>"All right," he returned, sullenly. "Have it
your own way, then! I'll get Louise to go with
me."</p>

<p>"Very well. Good-by." Her tone was icy;
she did not even offer to shake hands with him.</p>

<p>Ralph turned and hurried down the steps,
angry at himself for pleading so hard, angrier
at her for being so cold. No girl ever thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
of treating him&mdash;Ralph Clavering&mdash;like that
before! The very idea! Most young ladies
would be only too delighted at his invitation!
And all for the sake of a penniless, dishonest,
red-headed pilot! For Ralph had not yet
learned that there were some things which he
could not buy with his father's millions.</p>

<p>So he strode to the nearest telephone booth,
and called Louise Haydock who, although she
was flattered by the invitation, did not immediately
accept. She had already promised Harriman
Smith, and she so informed Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, there isn't any law that says a girl
can't go with two men, is there?" he demanded.
"If she happens to be popular enough! Can't
we all three go together?"</p>

<p>"Why aren't you going with Linda?" inquired
Louise, shrewdly.</p>

<p>"We've quarreled," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Then make it up!" she advised. "Pull
yourself together, Ralph&mdash;and apologize."</p>

<p>"I tried to, but it was no good. No, we're
off!"</p>

<p>"Then Linda hasn't any partner?"</p>

<p>"She says she's going with her aunt," muttered
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Oh, that won't do!" exclaimed Louise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
"Wait, Ralph, I'll fix everything. I'll get
Harry to take Linda&mdash;he's crazy about her
anyhow&mdash;and then I'll go with you."</p>

<p>"O.K., Lou. You're the little sport!"</p>

<p>"And fixer," added the girl, to herself, as
she bade Ralph good-by, and called first Harry
and then Miss Carlton.</p>

<p>Louise's suggestion seemed like an act of
Providence to the older woman; it would have
been mortifying indeed to her to have Linda
appear at the ball without a masculine escort,
as if the girl were a mere wallflower. Harriman
Smith had been most agreeable about the whole
arrangement; anything Louise decided suited
him, he told her. And Linda, too, was delighted
with the news.</p>

<p>She came out of her bedroom while her aunt
was talking on the telephone, dressed in her
flyer's suit.</p>

<p>"Where are you going dear?" inquired Miss
Carlton, in anxious surprise.</p>

<p>"I'm going scouting," explained Linda. "I
think I'll fly around&mdash;pretty low&mdash;and look for
wrecks. I have a hunch that that thief has
smashed his plane by now. He was such a poor
pilot, you know I told you."</p>

<p>"Well, be careful," cautioned her aunt. "But
so long as you fly low, I won't worry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>Linda smiled to herself. If Aunt Emily only
realized how infinitely more dangerous it was
to fly low than high!</p>

<p>She found her Pursuit in perfect condition,
and had it taken to the runway, where she
taxied off without the least difficulty. She
climbed to about fifteen hundred feet, and flew
over past the hospital and the field where the
Waco had been smashed. Then she carefully
came lower, using her glasses to watch the
ground as she flew.</p>

<p>The country was open&mdash;there were no buildings
and few trees, so she felt safe in keeping
within sight of the ground. She was flying along
confidently, when suddenly a long pole seemed
almost on top of her. Swerving sharply upward,
she just avoided striking some wires that
the pole was supporting.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she gasped. "What a lucky break!
Suppose I hadn't had a foolproof plane!" For
she knew that her Arrow had been designed
especially for amateurs like herself.</p>

<p>"Crazy of me to fly so near to the ground!"
she exclaimed, in self-contempt. "After all the
warnings I've had! I deserve a crash!" And
she continued to climb upward to safety.</p>

<p>As she flew onward, steadying her thoughts,
she decided that it was senseless to try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
hunt the thief with a plane. If she wanted to
look for him it would be much more reasonable
to use her car&mdash;or to hike. So she abandoned
that project entirely.</p>

<p>But as she continued her flight towards Green
Falls, it suddenly occurred to her that she
might help Ted in another way. She could establish
his alibi for him&mdash;by means of his company!
That red-haired man that the agent
claimed he saw with the thief couldn't have
been Ted, and she would take means of proving
it. Then, if Ralph's detectives insisted upon
throwing him into prison, there would be a
way to have him released.</p>

<p>So she flew back to the airport, confident
that her morning had not been entirely wasted,
and, to her aunt's relief, she arrived home in
time for lunch.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIII" id="Chapter_XIII"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIII</span></a><br />
<small>><i>The Masque Ball</i></small></h2>


<p>The gay young set at Green Falls to which
Linda belonged had planned nothing for that
afternoon except the regular swim, for the
ball would be late, and the donning of their
costumes would take a good deal of time. Linda,
however, even passed up the swim in favor of
a nap, for she was very tired. Besides, she had
no desire to meet Ralph at the lake or anywhere
else.</p>

<p>Like all the social affairs at this charming
resort, the masque ball&mdash;the greatest event of
the season, with the possible exception of the
field day at the close&mdash;began early. Dinner at
the Carltons was over by half-past seven, and,
after assuring herself that Linda's costume
was to her satisfaction, Miss Carlton left the
bungalow. She was a patroness, of course, and
she wanted to get to the Casino early, to pass
final judgment upon the decorations and the
music.</p>

<p>Harriman Smith arrived at half-past eight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
in a taxi, for as one of the poorer members of
the crowd, he did not possess a car of his own.
Linda, in the filmy dress of the fairy queen,
with a crown of golden stars about her hair,
welcomed him into the bungalow.</p>

<p>"Linda!" exclaimed the young man, in positive
awe. "I never saw anyone so beautiful in
my whole life!"</p>

<p>She smiled shyly, pleased at the compliment.
But of course as yet he had not seen the other
girls in their costumes!</p>

<p>"It's the dress," she explained modestly.
"If there's any credit, it should go to Aunt
Emily. She selected it.... I like your costume,
too, Harry. You're Robin Hood, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I'm glad you can recognize me, anyway....
But Linda, seriously, I just know
you'll take the prize for the most beautiful
woman!"</p>

<p>"I didn't know there was a prize."</p>

<p>"Of course there is. And for the most handsome
man. And the best dancers&mdash;and the funniest....
Probably some more I don't remember....
But I guess you never think much
about prizes."</p>

<p>"I do about some prizes," she admitted.
"Cups for endurance flights, and high altitudes&mdash;and
things like that!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Naturally&mdash;trust you to be up on anything
connected with airplanes. I suppose you'll be
winning some of them yourself sometime. But
when it comes to social events&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you're often the same way, Harry,"
she teased. "Look at the parties you passed
up last winter, just because of your engineering
course!"</p>

<p>The boy smiled, not at all displeased by the
observation, for he was a youth who took his
studies seriously. Unlike Maurice Stetson and
Ralph Clavering, who seemed interested only
in the fraternities and the sports at college, he
went there with the idea of working. And he
liked Linda all the better for recognizing his
ambition and understanding it.</p>

<p>"But we oughtn't to stand here talking, forgetting
all about your taxi," Linda reminded
her companion. "Why don't you dismiss it, and
take my car?"</p>

<p>"A queen mustn't drive!" he protested.
"And you wouldn't like me to run your
car&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't mind you, Harry. You're never
careless. It's people like Maurice that I can't
bear to see handle it."</p>

<p>"I don't blame you one bit," he said, and
realizing that she would really prefer to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
in her own roadster, he did as she suggested.</p>

<p>All the way to the Casino they both carefully
avoided any mention of Kitty Clavering's
loss, or, in fact, of anything distasteful&mdash;even
the quarrel with Ralph and the change of plans
which had thrown them together as partners.
Linda asked him how the different members of
the crowd had paired off, and Harry told her
as much as he had happened to learn at the
lake that afternoon. Kit and Maurice were of
course going together, and Dot Crowley and
Jim Valier&mdash;the smallest and the tallest members
of their set. Sara Wheeler had promised
Jackson Stiles, and Harry seemed to recall that
Sue Emery was accompanying Joe Sinclair.
He did not mention Louise and Ralph.</p>

<p>It was just a little before nine when they
reached the Casino, gayly lighted with Japanese
lanterns, and decorated with flowers and
streamers. The wide French windows of the
dance hall were all thrown open, and the huge
verandas were as beautifully lighted as the inside
of the Casino. Strains of music floated out
from the orchestra, which was already in place.
Upstairs there would be bridge tables for the
older members of the party and the supper
would be served on the roof-garden.</p>

<p>As the couple entered the wide doors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Casino, a surging of pride swept through the
young man because of the girl at his side. In
spite of her mask, people must recognize Linda
Carlton, so stately, so lovely, so charming!
With what wisdom her aunt had chosen that
costume! The girl was every inch a queen.</p>

<p>In the dressing-room there was naturally a
great deal of excitement, for the girls were
all trying to identify each other. Linda spotted
Louise immediately&mdash;dressed as an Egyptian
Princess. Her costume was unusual, daring;
she stood out among all the others as a sunflower
might among a bunch of spring blossoms.
And of course she wore huge, odd, earrings.</p>

<p>"Linda, you're sweet!" she cried, starting
forward to kiss her chum, and stopping just in
time as she remembered the make-up on her
lips, and the amount of time she had consumed
putting it there.</p>

<p>"Sh!" warned Linda. "Don't give me
away!"</p>

<p>"I won't, darling. But everybody will know
you anyhow. Come on&mdash;you couldn't possibly
improve yourself! And we must hurry. I hear
them lining up now for the grand march."</p>

<p>A laughing, happy group, the girls made
their way back to the ballroom where their part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>ners
claimed them. It amused Linda&mdash;and yet
it hurt her a little, too&mdash;to see Ralph Clavering
lead Louise away without even seeming to notice
her. But Harry Smith was right there too,
as if to protect his partner from any unpleasantness.</p>

<p>The music of the grand march rolled out triumphantly,
and the couples fell into step, circling
the big room, and walking past the committee
on the raised platform, whose members
were to pass judgment on the costumes for the
awarding of the prizes. As Linda walked demurely
at Harry's side, past this intent, solemn
body of men and women, she never lifted her
eyes. She was all the more amazed when, a
couple of minutes later, she heard a childish
voice cry out above the music.</p>

<p>"Does 'ou fink me cute?" and, turning about,
Linda recognized Dot Crowley, dressed as a
little school-girl, and actually calling attention
to herself. Of course everybody laughed; you
just had to smile at Dot. And her long-legged
partner, Jim Valier, dressed appropriately as
Uncle Sam, looked so out-of-place at her side.</p>

<p>The costumes were really marvelous; if
Linda had not come for any other reason than
to see them, it would have been worth while.
There were several hundred people at the ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the proceeds of which were given entirely to
charity, and though there were naturally many
repetitions&mdash;numerous George and Martha
Washingtons, Pierrots and Pierrettes, clowns
and gypsies, there were also many unusual
ones. But although she did not realize it, there
was no one in that whole assembly so charmingly
beautiful as Linda Carlton.</p>

<p>The grand march consumed almost an hour,
after which the judges withdrew to make their
decisions, and then the dancing began.</p>

<p>The floor was perfect and the music excellent;
Linda fell into step with her partner and
gave herself up to the enjoyment the pastime
always afforded her. Whenever she had a good
partner like Harry&mdash;or Ralph&mdash;she always experienced
a marvelous sensation of floating
along to the strains of the music, a sensation
that somehow reminded her of flying. And then
they passed Ralph and Louise, and Linda wondered
whether the former would ask her to
dance.</p>

<p>After that she danced with all the boys she
knew, in turn&mdash;all except Ralph. Even when
Harry managed a dance with Louise, while
Linda was dancing with a stag, Ralph did not
cut in. But this did not spoil her good time,
for she felt that she had been in the right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
championing Ted, even though her father was
on the other side.</p>

<p>Ralph's avoidance of her niece had not
escaped Miss Carlton's eyes, and she sighed.
Why was there always some drawback to rich
people, she wondered? But perhaps Ralph
would get over his childishness when he grew
older. And in the meantime Linda did not lack
for attention.</p>

<p>Just before the party went up to the roof for
supper, the prizes were awarded. Linda Carlton
won first prize for the women&mdash;and, ludicrous
as it was, Ralph Clavering, as King
Arthur, was selected first among the men. They
walked across the floor together, Linda giving
him a shy smile. To Louise and Harry, and Miss
Carlton, who knew about the tiff, the coincidence
was very amusing.</p>

<p>Two other guests whom Linda did not know
were awarded the prizes for the funniest costumes,
and, to their own amazement, Louise
and Ralph were called out as the couple who
had given the best exhibition of dancing. There
was no shyness as these two stepped forward.
Ralph, looking roguish, held out his arms and
whistled a tune, and as Louise slipped into
them, they waltzed across the floor.</p>

<p>The supper was gorgeous in every detail:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the food was excellent, the service perfect.
Linda felt that she had never been to quite so
magnificent a party before.</p>

<p>"You do like all this, don't you, Linda?"
asked her partner, as they finished their ice-cream,
molded in fancy forms, like small dolls
or figurines, in pastel colors. "You really like
parties? Because I sometimes wonder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I love them," replied the girl, her eyes shining.
"That is, when they come once or twice a
summer, like this. But I would get awfully tired
of them if I had nothing else."</p>

<p>"But next winter," he reminded her, "when
you are a dÃ©butante&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to try not to be," she interrupted.
"If I can slide out of it, without hurting Aunt
Emily's feelings. I want to go to a ground
school, and study aviation seriously."</p>

<p>"You mean make it your life work?" he
asked, respectfully.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;seriously."</p>

<p>But it was no time to talk; the music had
started again, and everybody wanted to make
good use of the last, best hour of the party.</p>

<p>And so for all that evening, Linda Carlton
was the care-free, popular girl that her Aunt
Emily loved her to be.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIV" id="Chapter_XIV"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIV</span></a><br />
<small><i>The Flying Trip</i></small></h2>


<p>About eight o'clock the following morning
while her friends were still sleeping, Linda
Carlton, clad in a bathing-suit and a beach robe,
dashed down to the lake. She thought an early
morning swim before anyone was up would
clear her brain and give her a chance to think
over her plans and come to a decision. If possible,
she meant to get in touch with Ted's company
before the detectives arrived at his home
to arrest him.</p>

<p>She had thought, naturally, that she would
find the lake deserted, for everybody ought to
be tired out after last night's party. She was
therefore amazed and a little annoyed to see
some one else already in swimming.</p>

<p>"I'll go in the other direction," she decided,
but before she was even in the water she heard
a familiar voice calling her.</p>

<p>"Linda!" cried Louise Haydock, waving her
arms, and starting to swim rapidly towards her.
"Ho&mdash;Linda!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lou!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;me!" shouted the other girl. "But
did you say 'Who' or 'You'?"</p>

<p>"I said 'Lou'!" replied Linda, laughing
good-naturedly. It was a relief to find the other
bather was her chum.</p>

<p>They were within talking distance now, and
Louise hurried to the shore. They sat down
together and gossiped about the party, Louise
laughing over Ralph's childishness in trying
to keep up the quarrel with Linda.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, Linda," she added,
"I'm bored with him. As a matter of fact, I'm
fed up with most of the boys. Harry's all right,
but he has so little time. All the others are so
pleased with themselves. They think we can't
get along without them!"</p>

<p>"Well, can we?" teased Linda.</p>

<p>"Why not? Except for dances&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Linda dug her toes into the sand and smiled.</p>

<p>"That's the trouble with us. There's always
some 'except.' We ought to make up our minds
to stay away from dancing, if we really want
them to get over their superiority complex."</p>

<p>"It would be pretty dull in the evenings&mdash;we'd
have to find something else to take its
place...." Louise paused to watch an airplane
that was flying overhead. "Linda!" she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
cried, abruptly, "I have it! Let's go off on a
trip&mdash;just the two of us&mdash;in your plane! Be
gone a week or two!"</p>

<p>Linda grabbed her chum's hands in delight.
What a marvelous idea! The freedom! The
adventure of it! And she could link it up with
her own errand to Kansas City.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd adore that, Lou!" she exclaimed.
"Would you really trust yourself to me? Honestly?
You wouldn't be afraid?"</p>

<p>Louise put her arm about the other girl and
hugged her tightly.</p>

<p>"Of course I would! I have an awful lot of
confidence in you. And I'd love it!"</p>

<p>Linda's brow darkened suddenly. For as always,
she had to think of others besides herself.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Louise,
watching her companion's face.</p>

<p>"I am thinking of Aunt Emily&mdash;and your
mother," answered Linda. "Wondering
whether they'd give their consent&mdash;and if they
did, would they worry themselves to death?"</p>

<p>"Mother would be all right&mdash;I can manage
her, and Dad too," said Louise confidently.
"And, after all, think of the flying that girls
do now-a-days. A little picnic like this is tame,
compared to flying from England to Australia."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know&mdash;but Aunt Emily's so scary
about planes."</p>

<p>"Well, I tell you what we could do&mdash;we could
map out our whole trip beforehand, and decide
where we would land each night. We could probably
get the names of the hotels where we
would stay. And each evening after supper, we
could telephone the people at home."</p>

<p>"That's an idea!" agreed Linda, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't want to camp out, anyway,
would you? They would be sure to object to
that&mdash;just two girls alone."</p>

<p>"No; we'd have to buy a lot of equipment,
and I'd hate to load down the plane. But I'm
afraid Aunt Emily would even object to our
staying alone at hotels. You know how particular
she is."</p>

<p>Louise was silent a moment, thinking it was
too pleasant an idea to give up at once. She'd
have to devise a way out of their difficulty.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," she announced, finally. "We
can plan to stop with people we know each
night&mdash;or at a hotel where some friend is staying.
We surely can round up some relatives and
friends!"</p>

<p>"That's it!" cried Linda, joyfully. "That
ought to be easy! And we can send telegrams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
ahead. But the places will have to have some
sort of airports."</p>

<p>"Oh, most every town has some kind of landing
place," said Louise. "I don't think that
need worry us."</p>

<p>"There's another thing," added Linda,
slowly. "I'd want to start today. Because I
must go to Kansas City as fast as I can." And
she explained to Louise her plan about establishing
Ted's alibi.</p>

<p>Louise leaped into the air in her excitement
and approval.</p>

<p>"That's great! You know me, Linda&mdash;I always
hate to wait about anything. We can pack
our suit-cases and send our wires in an hour
if we hustle. Hurry up! Hop in for a dip, and
come right back!"</p>

<p>Ten minutes later they dashed breathless
and wet into the dining-room of the Carlton
bungalow, where Miss Carlton was eating a
leisurely breakfast. In their excitement over
their idea they could scarcely explain it. But
at last the older woman understood; she heard
them out, and gave her rather reluctant consent.</p>

<p>"If you don't make the trip too long," she
added.</p>

<p>"A week?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't four days enough? Then we would
have to arrange only two stopping places&mdash;the
same one coming back. And I am sure I could
do that very easily."</p>

<p>The girls agreed, delighted even with a compromise.
Nothing they had ever done promised
to be half so thrilling.</p>

<p>They would fly southwest, making their first
stop Kansas City, where Ted's firm was located.
Searching through her address-book,
Miss Carlton remembered that she had a cousin
living in a hotel in that city and she wired her
immediately to reserve a room for the girls
for that night, and to chaperon their visit.</p>

<p>"And then we'll fly to Sunny Hills&mdash;as our
destination!" cried Louise, with happy inspiration.
"It's in Colorado&mdash;where my Aunt Margaret
and Uncle John live! Oh, we'll have no
end of fun there!"</p>

<p>"You're sure they won't mind?" asked
Linda.</p>

<p>"They'll be tickled to death. They have a
huge place&mdash;sort of a farm&mdash;and six children.
Of course they're not children now&mdash;several of
them are married&mdash;but they always keep open
house. We used to go there a lot when I was
a kid."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;you send that wire," agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Linda, as she hastily swallowed some food, "and
I'll get ready and go down to my plane, and see
that it's O.K."</p>

<p>"How about some lunch?" suggested her
Aunt Emily.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, please&mdash;if you don't mind!"</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time the girls were
dressed, their suit-cases packed, the wires sent,
and the lunch in readiness. About half-past ten,
without saying a word of good-by to anyone
except Miss Carlton and Louise's parents, they
took off.</p>

<p>The sky was clear and blue, without even a
cloud to threaten them with fog or storm. It
was Louise's first ride in a plane, yet she was
not a bit afraid. She said she had never been
so thrilled before.</p>

<p>"I'm getting the craze, Linda!" she shouted,
above the noise of the motor. "If I only had a
suit like yours!"</p>

<p>She was wearing her riding-breeches and a
tan sweater-blouse, with a close-fitting hat of
the same color&mdash;a costume, which though neat
and appropriate, had none of the style and
charm of her companion's.</p>

<p>"But you can't wear earrings!" teased
Linda, pulling at Louise's ears to make sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
that the other girl heard and understood what
she was saying.</p>

<p>"In the suit-case!" returned Louise, laughing
and pointing towards the article she named.</p>

<p>But neither of the girls wanted to try to talk.
They were content to rise higher and higher
into the air, to feel the glorious sensation of
smooth flying, knowing that everything was
just right. Both of them began to sing.</p>

<p>On, on they went, over fields and towns,
watching their map and their instruments,
dipping now and then to catch a glimpse of the
landscape below, climbing back to the heights
for safety. As the clock on their plane neared
twelve, they realized they were hungry, because
breakfast had been such a sketchy affair for
them both. Louise untied the box, and they ate
joyously. Their first meal in the air!</p>

<p>It was still early when they arrived at Kansas
City, and Linda flew a straight, swift
course to the large grounds that were occupied
by the company for which Ted Mackay worked.
Without the slightest mishap or difficulty Linda
brought her plane to a perfect landing in the
large area set aside for that purpose.</p>

<p>A nice-looking young man in a flyer's uniform
came to them in welcome. His face showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
no surprise; it was evidently an every-day occurrence
to meet feminine pilots.</p>

<p>"I would like to speak to the sales-manager,"
said Linda, after she had answered his greeting,
and made sure that this was the right place.
"I want to make some inquiries about Ted
Mackay."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed the young man. "I'll take
you to Mr. Jordan immediately."</p>

<p>But when they were introduced, Linda felt
suddenly shy. What right had she, she asked
herself, to pry into Ted's affairs? She wasn't
a relative&mdash;or even a friend, if she adhered to
her father's command. So it was Louise who
came to the rescue, as she always did in emergencies,
and proceeded to take charge of the
interview.</p>

<p>"You see," she explained, "the people who
had that valuable necklace stolen are pretty
much perturbed over the whole affair&mdash;and
naturally they hired detectives. Well, Mr. Jordan&mdash;you
know what detectives are! They
bungle everything."</p>

<p>"Yes?" remarked the man, looking smilingly
from one girl to the other, thinking that they,
too, were rather excited.</p>

<p>"And just because they found Mr. Mackay
by the stolen plane, and because they located a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
gasoline agent who swears that he sold gas to
a red-haired man for that same plane earlier in
the day, they're sure Mr. Mackay is a thief."</p>

<p>"And they're going to his home&mdash;to arrest
him!" put in Linda, now more at ease.</p>

<p>"But they can't prove anything," Mr. Jordan
assured them, calmly.</p>

<p>"Oh, but they say they'll put third degree
on him, or whatever it is, and force him to a
confession. And&mdash;and&mdash;think of his poor
mother!"</p>

<p>"But what do you girls want me to do?" he
asked. "I don't see how I can stop them!"</p>

<p>"We just want you to establish his alibi,"
explained Louise. "Write down everything Mr.
Mackay did from early morning till the time
he started off in that new plane."</p>

<p>"O.K.!" exclaimed Mr. Jordan, a light
breaking over his face. "That's easy! We had a
salesmen's meeting at the Winton Hotel, and
lunched together. I can swear Mackay was
there&mdash;and so can half a dozen others. We came
back here about three o'clock, and Mackay was
looking over the plane and studying his maps
for about half an hour. Then he took off&mdash;for
Buffalo."</p>

<p>"That's just what we want!" cried Linda,
and Louise added, "wonderful!" and squeezed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the elderly man's hand. He smiled at her as if
she were his daughter.</p>

<p>"And will you dictate that to a stenographer,
and send a copy to Ted by air-mail?" urged
Linda.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he agreed.</p>

<p>"And now," added Linda, "will one of your
mechanics look over my plane and put it away
till tomorrow? We want to get our suit-cases,
and taxi to my cousin's hotel."</p>

<p>So, half an hour later, when the girls were
making themselves known to the elderly couple
who were expecting them, they spoke joyously
of the perfect success of their first day's adventure,
but they did not mention their mission
on Ted Mackay's behalf.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="Chapter_XV" id="Chapter_XV"><span class="smcap">Chapter XV</span></a><br />
<small><i>Sunny Hills</i></small></h2>


<p>The girls' visit with the elderly couple at
the hotel at Kansas City was restful, but uneventful.
As soon as they arrived, Linda telephoned
to her aunt over long distance, and
made a satisfactory report. Dinner and the
movies occupied their evening.</p>

<p>Early the next morning they bade their host
and hostess a temporary farewell&mdash;for they
were scheduled to return in a couple of days&mdash;and
took a taxi to the airplane company where
their Arrow was being kept.</p>

<p>"It's a little cloudy, girls," observed Mr.
Jordan as he came over to meet them. "But I
don't think it will actually storm before night.
Are you going far?"</p>

<p>"To a place called 'Sunny Hills'," replied
Louise, producing her map. "In Colorado."</p>

<p>The man studied it for a few minutes, and
then pointed out their best course.</p>

<p>"And your plane's O.K.," he added. "She
certainly is a neat little boat."</p>

<p>"I'm fond of her myself!" replied Linda,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
her eyes shining as they always did when she
spoke of her most precious possession.</p>

<p>"And have you had any word from Mr.
Mackay?" asked Louise.</p>

<p>"Yes. He's coming back today," answered
Mr. Jordan. "I sent a plane for him, with the
letter you suggested. The pilot wired last night
that he arrived safely, and both men would be
back on the job tomorrow."</p>

<p>"He didn't say anything about the detectives?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"Then everything must be all right!"
breathed Linda, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Well, good-by," concluded Mr. Jordan, as
the girls stepped into their plane. "And fly
carefully. That's rather lonely country you're
passing over."</p>

<p>"But the skies are safe!" returned Linda, as
she started her motor.</p>

<p>It was indeed a more desolate stretch of land
than any they had flown over before. The girls
noticed this as they sped on, the miles piling
up in rapid succession.</p>

<p>This time they carried no lunch, for they had
hesitated to ask at the hotel, and as the hours
passed, they grew very hungry. Moreover, the
sky was so cloudy that the sun was totally ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>scured,
and they had to be guided entirely by
instruments. Two or three times they seemed
to get off their course, and it was almost five
o'clock when they finally landed at an airport
and inquired their way to Sunny Hills.</p>

<p>"It's about five miles north," they were told.
"But wouldn't you rather leave your plane and
taxi over?" their informer suggested.</p>

<p>"No, thanks," replied Linda. "Because we
want to have our plane there, to use it if we
need it, and to show to our friends. But we
would love to have something to eat, if you can
tell us where there is a stand for refreshments."</p>

<p>While the man was leading them to a sandwich
booth, a mechanic came up and filled the
plane with gas, and at Linda's request, looked
it over hastily. Fifteen minutes later the girls
took off again, having been assured that there
was a field for landing at Sunny Hills, because,
it seemed, the owner&mdash;or possibly the owner's
son&mdash;had a plane.</p>

<p>As they descended over the field in back of
the huge country house that was the home of
the Stillmans the girls observed numerous people
running out of the doors and from the
porches to be on hand to welcome them. By
the time they had landed, Louise counted seventeen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, everybody!" she shouted, as the
noise of the motor died. "Get our wire?"</p>

<p>"Surest thing!" answered a man of about
thirty, tall and heavily-built, and smiling.</p>

<p>An elderly woman was pressing through the
throng, holding out her arms to Louise.</p>

<p>"Aunt Margaret!" cried the girl, rapturously.
"I'm so glad to see you! And I want to
introduce my chum&mdash;Linda Carlton."</p>

<p>"I am more than delighted to meet you, my
dear," said Mrs. Stillman, pressing Linda's
hand&mdash;"I am <i>proud</i> to meet you!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," murmured the girl, her eyelids
fluttering in embarrassment, for she felt that
as yet she had done nothing to merit praise.</p>

<p>"And now I'll tell you everybody's name,"
continued the older woman. "Though I know
you can't possibly remember them."</p>

<p>She proceeded to introduce her friends and
her children&mdash;the latter all younger than Roger,
the man who had first spoken to them, and evidently
her oldest son. There were four small
children among the group, two of them grandchildren
of Mrs. Stillman.</p>

<p>"I want you girls to use my hangar," offered
Roger, immediately. "My plane's away getting
repaired. So shall I put yours away for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks!" replied Linda, gratefully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
"It's so nice to find another pilot&mdash;to do the
honors, and the work!"</p>

<p>As the happy, noisy group walked with the
two girls back to the house, they asked all sorts
of questions at once, about the trip, the plane,
the relatives back home. Louise and Linda answered
as fast as they could, but finally gave
up, laughing in their confusion.</p>

<p>"Now everybody stop talking!" commanded
Mrs. Stillman, and though her tone was jovial,
Linda could see at once that she meant what
she said, and that she was used to being obeyed.</p>

<p>"Our brave flyers must be awfully tired, and
this is no way to treat them, before they have
even had a drink of water. Elsie," she nodded
to a girl about Linda's age, "I want you to take
the girls to their room, and I'll send up their
suit-cases and some iced tea. And then they are
going to have peace until dinner-time!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Margaret, we're not so tired,"
protested Louise. Still, the thought of a cool
shower, iced tea, and a few minutes for a nap
was very pleasant.</p>

<p>Elsie and Louise, who had been great friends
when they were younger, spending several long,
happy summers together, were both delighted
at the chance of renewing their friendship.
Linda, too, found Elsie charming, and the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
girls were soon chatting merrily over their iced
tea.</p>

<p>"I want you to tell me the news of your
family first," said Louise. "And begin in order,
so Linda can get them straightened out. I mean&mdash;which
ones are married, and which have children,
and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, do," urged Linda. "I only know Roger&mdash;because
he is a pilot&mdash;and you, by name."</p>

<p>A knock at the door interrupted them, and
when Elsie answered it, two young men brought
in the girls' suit-cases.</p>

<p>"The twins," explained their sister. "Dan
and David. It really isn't hard to tell them
apart, if you look closely."</p>

<p>"I remember!" cried Louise. "Your hair is
curlier, isn't it, Dan? And David has a broken
finger."</p>

<p>"Righto," agreed the latter, holding up his
finger for inspection, and keeping his eyes on
Linda. He had fallen for her charms already.</p>

<p>"You're excused," said Elsie, tersely.</p>

<p>"With many thanks," added Linda, graciously.</p>

<p>"Now begin over again," urged Louise, when
the boys had gone. She began to open the suit-cases
and to pull out the negligees, so that they
could be perfectly comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," continued Elsie, settling back in the
pretty cretonne-covered chair that matched all
the furnishings of the lovely, yet simple bedroom,
"you know Aunt Margaret, of course.
Those other two elderly women are friends&mdash;no
need for you to learn their names.</p>

<p>"Of us, Roger is the oldest&mdash;he's thirty-one&mdash;and
he isn't married. He's had dozens of
girls, but I think he loves being a bachelor. He
goes in for all kinds of racing&mdash;motorboat, automobile,
and now airplane. And he adores
young girls. You want to watch your step,
Linda, for we're always expecting him to marry
all of a sudden sometime. To somebody a whole
lot younger!"</p>

<p>Linda smiled, and Louise shook her head
knowingly.</p>

<p>"Linda's wise," she remarked.</p>

<p>"And Anita's the next oldest," went on
Elsie. "I guess you didn't recognize her, did
you, Louise? The stout woman, with those two
children clinging to her."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't!" exclaimed her cousin. "But
remember, it's been ten years since our family
were here. I do recall her now&mdash;she was a High
School graduate that summer. And so thin!"</p>

<p>"Well, she's fat now, and so is her husband.
You'll see him tonight&mdash;they're spending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
summer here. They have two kids.... The
twins come next&mdash;they're twenty-three, and
then my other married sister Jennie. You remember
Jen?"</p>

<p>"Naturally!"</p>

<p>"And I'm the baby!" concluded Elsie, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"But does that account for that whole
crowd?" asked Linda. "Lou said she counted
seventeen."</p>

<p>"Oh, the others were gardeners, and gardeners'
children, and servants. There are
twelve of us at dinner every night, with father
and Anita's husband. And you girls will make
fourteen."</p>

<p>"I always thought it would be wonderful to
have a big family," sighed Linda. "My aunt
and I live all alone, except once in a while when
my father comes home."</p>

<p>"All the more reason why you should spend
a couple of weeks with us!" urged Elsie, cordially.</p>

<p>"We'd love to, but we can't," answered
Louise. "But we'll promise to come oftener,
now that Linda has her Arrow."</p>

<p>"And that reminds me," put in Linda, "that
we must call our folks."</p>

<p>Elsie handed her a telephone, which was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
a little table beside the bed, and made her excuses
and left them alone. It was almost time
to dress for dinner.</p>

<p>Before the girls had answered the summons
of the gong, the rain, which had been threatening
all day long, came in torrents. But it did
not dampen the spirits of the happy group that
was gathered about the long table.</p>

<p>David Stillman, a starry-eyed young man
with a serious expression, had managed to persuade
his mother to let him sit next to Linda
on her left, while Roger, the eldest, had naturally
preÃ«mpted the place on her right. The
younger man, it seemed, believed her to be the
ideal girl he had always dreamed of. He tried
almost immediately to make her promise to play
tennis with him, to go canoeing and swimming.
Roger, on the other hand, saw two days' fun
ahead of him, playing with the girls and the
plane, and he made up his mind not to give his
younger brother a chance.</p>

<p>Sizing up Linda immediately as a girl seriously
interested in aviation, he began to talk
on that subject, shutting out poor David completely.
He told her about his plane, and the
trips he had made, and the races he had won.</p>

<p>"But you are a new pilot, aren't you?" he
asked her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, why?" she asked. "Did I do anything
wrong?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed! You fly like an old-timer. But
what I mean is, you haven't gone in for any
competitions yet, have you? Air-derbys, endurance
flights&mdash;height records?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't had time."</p>

<p>"But you will?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I want to do something. But
just what...."</p>

<p>"You have a wonderful opportunity," continued
Roger. "Because you have ambition, and
time, and youth&mdash;and enough money to back
you." He paused to eat a generous slice of
roast-beef. Unlike David, who was staring
moodily at his plate and playing with his food,
Roger ate with enormous appetite. "You see,
the trouble with most of us is, that we haven't
the time and the money. And the very rich are
seldom ambitious."</p>

<p>"I am hoping to do something next year,"
Linda announced, slowly. "But not until I
study some more."</p>

<p>"Wise girl!" was his comment. "I wish my
kid brother&mdash;Dan&mdash;were of the same opinion. I
can hardly keep him out of my plane&mdash;and he
hasn't even a license. He's a perfect pest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Won't you please talk to me?" entreated
a voice on the other side, and turning her head,
Linda realized for the first time how she had
been neglecting David.</p>

<p>"I'll give you all the rest of the dinner-time!"
she said, laughingly. But the conversation
at once became so general that she did not
have a chance to keep her promise.</p>

<p>After dinner the rain abated, but nobody went
out except Dan, who said he was always looking
for adventure. But in such a crowd, they did
not miss him; the young people danced and
sang and played pool and ping-pong in the
game-room.</p>

<p>They were just finishing some lemonade and
cake which Mrs. Stillman had brought out for
their refreshment, when a telegram arrived for
Linda. Her mind flew instantly to Ted Mackay,
wondering whether he had been arrested in
spite of all her efforts to help him.</p>

<p>But the news proved worse than anything
she had expected. It was from her aunt.</p>

<p>"Your father seriously hurt. Fly to ranch
at once."</p>

<p>Helplessly, she handed the telegram to Mrs.
Stillman, who read it aloud to the others. Heroically,
Linda managed to keep from crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank Heaven for the Pursuit!" cried
Louise, who had her arms about her chum.
"We'll get there in no time."</p>

<p>"Let me go with you," suggested Roger.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;thank you," stammered Linda, clinging
to Louise. "I need Lou&mdash;more than anybody."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll map out your course for
you," offered the young man. "It's strange
country to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I've never been to this ranch before.
Dad had another one that I used to visit, when
I was a child." And she gave Roger the exact
location.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, with their arms still entwined,
Linda and Louise went up to their
room, having exacted a promise from Mrs.
Stillman to waken them at five o'clock the following
morning.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Chapter_XVI" id="Chapter_XVI"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVI</span></a><br />
<small><i>The Accident</i></small></h2>


<p>At seven o'clock the following morning,
after eating the hearty breakfast upon which
Mrs. Stillman insisted, the girls entered the
Pursuit, and taxied off, waving farewell to
Elsie, Roger, and their hostess. Of the large
family, only these three&mdash;and the cook&mdash;had
risen in time to say good-by. Even David had
overslept; but his eldest brother was on hand
to help the girls get their start.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the rain was over, and both
Linda and Roger believed that, barring mishaps,
the flyers should reach their destination
early in the afternoon. With this hope, both
girls kept their spirits high; they refused to
worry about Linda's father until they saw for
themselves. For Miss Carlton was likely to look
upon the dark side of things, and it was probable
too that the help at the ranch were frightened
by the accident to their employer.</p>

<p>Tears of gratitude came to Linda's eyes
when she saw the enormous lunch which Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Stillman had been able to provide at such short
notice, and she did not know how to thank the
kind woman or her son. So she merely smiled
gratefully, and waved good-by.</p>

<p>Louise kept the map of their course in her
lap, and for two hours they flew on, making no
attempt to talk, but every once in a while pressing
each other's hand in sympathy and affection.</p>

<p>As the sun was growing hotter and higher in
the sky, Linda was beginning to wonder
whether they were not somewhat off their
course. She examined the map.</p>

<p>"We ought to be nearing that town!" she
shouted, pointing to a spot which Roger indicated
by a large dot on the map. "And I don't
believe that we are."</p>

<p>"Fly lower!" suggested Louise. "Let's see!"</p>

<p>Cautiously the young pilot descended, but
though both girls looked eagerly, there were
no roofs or other evidences of a town. An almost
continuous expanse of shrubbery seemed
to cover the ground, and Linda did not care
to land.</p>

<p>So she went higher again, and pointed her
plane south, trusting that they were right.</p>

<p>For two hours more they continued to fly
without seeing any of the landmarks for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
they were so eagerly watching. Afterwards
Linda remarked that she believed they had been
going in a circle.</p>

<p>The sun was almost directly overhead now,
and both girls were feeling hungry, for their
breakfast, though substantial, had been an
early one. They were just considering opening
their box to eat, when Linda noticed a queer
noise in the motor.</p>

<p>"Something's wrong, Lou!" she shouted,
trying to smile as if she were not worried.
"We'll have to land."</p>

<p>"Here?" gasped Louise, in horror.</p>

<p>"Yes. Watch the ground! We must find a
good place."</p>

<p>Louise was gazing about at the sky and the
horizon, when, turning around, she happened
to glance at her companion's face. A set look
had come into Linda's eyes, her lips were rigid.
Uneven, yet deafening, was the threatening
sound of the motor. Suddenly it let off a terrific
explosion.</p>

<p>"Will we be killed?" screamed Louise,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>Linda did not try to answer. She needed every
ounce of brain power, of energy for the test
that was ahead of her. She was working frantically
with the joystick. So Louise too, kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
quiet, and looked over the side of the plane&mdash;and
prayed.</p>

<p>At first it seemed they were dropping terrifically;
but gradually, frightened though she
was, she could feel that some safety device was
taking hold. The speed was lessening. Down,
down they went, but more gradually now.</p>

<p>And then they were close enough to the
ground to see it. A woods of stumpy trees
stretched under them, but over to the right was
a field. Would Linda be able to guide the plane
there, or must they be dashed against the tree-tops,
to meet a sickening death?</p>

<p>How would it feel to be dead, Louise wondered.
And oh, her poor mother and father!
Even in those few seconds, it seemed as if her
whole life flashed before her, and although she
was really a very sweet girl, she believed herself
a monster of ingratitude. Not a bit like
Linda&mdash;who was always thinking of her Aunt
Emily and her father!</p>

<p>Linda, on the other hand, had no time for
any such thoughts. She was working as she had
never worked before, guiding her stricken
plane. And&mdash;miracle of miracles&mdash;they were
passing the tree-tops! They were over a field
of weeds.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" cried Louise, reverently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait!" whispered Linda, not sure yet that
they were safe.</p>

<p>The landing was not easy. The plane came
down and hit the ground and bounced up again.
Suppose it should pancake? Linda held her
breath, suffering greater agony than Louise,
who knew less of the dangers. But in a moment
the valiant little Arrow came to a stop, in the
shrubbery.</p>

<p>In a rapture of relief and thanksgiving,
Louise grasped Linda and kissed her, while the
tears ran down the young pilot's face. For a
moment the girls sat thus in silent embrace,
each too filled with emotion to speak.</p>

<p>"Come, let's get out, Lou," said Linda,
finally, and shakily they both stepped from the
plane.</p>

<p>"I wonder where we are," remarked Louise,
trying to make her voice sound natural.</p>

<p>"We'll get out our maps and study the situation.
But first let's eat. I'm simply famished.
It must be noon at least."</p>

<p>They found upon consulting Louise's wrist-watch
that it was ten minutes of one.</p>

<p>Resolutely deciding to be cheerful, they
opened the hamper which Louise's Aunt Margaret
had packed. What a delicious lunch!</p>

<p>There was a whole roast chicken, and tiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
dainty lettuce sandwiches&mdash;at least a dozen of
them. Pears and cherries, and lemonade in a
thermos bottle. And a beautiful little layer cake
evidently baked just especially for them,
though how the cook had managed it, they had
no idea. They spread out the paper cloth and
attacked the food ravenously.</p>

<p>"It looks pretty desolate around here," remarked
Louise, as she nibbled at a chicken leg.
"I don't see a house in sight."</p>

<p>"Or a road either, for that matter," returned
Linda. "I wish we could get to a telephone&mdash;and
send a call for assistance."</p>

<p>They ate silently for a while. How good the
food tasted! In spite of their distress and
worry, both girls enjoyed that lunch.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea what is wrong with the
plane?" asked Louise, as she broke off a piece
of chocolate cake. "It was all right yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yes. That mechanic at the airport gave it a
hasty examination. Funny he didn't notice anything
so serious as this.... Louise, do you
suppose that Roger could have done anything
to it?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Louise, thoughtfully. "No;
I think Roger knows what he's about. But I
have an idea, Linda."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you remember hearing a plane very
close to the house when we were playing ping-pong
last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought it was the air-mail."</p>

<p>"So did I. But I believe now it was the Pursuit&mdash;with
Dan piloting!"</p>

<p>"Dan Stillman?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He's a regular daredevil. And you
know Roger won't let him fly his plane."</p>

<p>A pained look came into Linda's eyes, as if
she herself had been mistreated.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lou, that seems awful," she said. "He
wouldn't do a thing like that, would he?"</p>

<p>"He must have. Remember, he went out right
after supper. And he's so conceited. He
wouldn't think he could hurt it. But I'll tell you
how to find out&mdash;look at the gas. You remember
you had her filled at that airport."</p>

<p>Holding their cake in their hands, both girls
dashed excitedly back to the plane and looked at
the dial which indicated how much gasoline was
left. And, sure enough, the supply was running
low! Too low to be accounted for by the
flying they had done that morning. In fact, it
was almost gone.</p>

<p>"You're right!" cried Linda. "Oh, Lou, now
we're in a worse pickle than ever. We'll never
get to Daddy!" The tears ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't!" urged her chum, putting her arms
around the other girl. "Don't give up yet! We'll
find somebody&mdash;on some road&mdash;who will send
a mechanic to us. And we'll be at the ranch before
night!"</p>

<p>"I hope so!" replied Linda, bravely trying
to keep up her courage.</p>

<p>They went back to the spot where their lunch
was spread&mdash;luckily there was plenty left for
supper, in case they needed it&mdash;and packed the
remainder again. Then, arm in arm, they set out
in quest of a road. They walked in an easterly
direction; that much they knew from the sun.</p>

<p>What they saw appeared to be a flat country,
without even any fences or signs of cultivation.
Gazing off in the distance, they could faintly
distinguish the outline of a house&mdash;but it might
be five miles away, or it might be fifteen. Or it
might not be a house at all; perhaps just some
abandoned building or mill.</p>

<p>For half an hour they walked aimlessly onward,
till they finally reached a dirt road.</p>

<p>"This is encouraging," said Louise, hopefully.
"Let's drop down and wait here till something
passes. We don't want to get too far
from the plane&mdash;if we get out of sight, we
might not be able to find our way back."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>They sat down on some moss by a small tree
and consulted the time. It was half-past two.</p>

<p>Everything was extremely still. No noise of
motor or traffic anywhere. No voices. So strange
after the places they were used to, for even
Green Falls was noisy. And the birds were
quiet, too&mdash;or perhaps there weren't many, for
there were no big trees.</p>

<p>Linda yawned. "I'm so sleepy."</p>

<p>"Take a nap," suggested Louise. "You deserve
one!"</p>

<p>"Hardly fair," returned the other. "Aren't
you sleepy too?"</p>

<p>"Not so sleepy as you are. Go ahead! I'll
wake you if anything comes along."</p>

<p>"And suppose nothing does?"</p>

<p>"Then I'll wake you anyway at three o'clock.
We'll have to strike out in some other direction."</p>

<p>So Linda curled up and went to sleep, and
Louise, yawning, wondered how she could possibly
manage to keep awake. The whole atmosphere
was so drowsy&mdash;and there was nothing
to do.</p>

<p>"If only there were a place to swim," she
thought, regretfully. "Cold water would make
me a different girl!"</p>

<p>But there wasn't any water at all, as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
she knew; indeed, she and Linda didn't dare
wash in the small supply they carried with
them. For they might need it for drinking.</p>

<p>She never knew how it happened, but soon
she too was peacefully asleep. For two whole
hours both girls slept the dreamless sleep of
fatigue. Then, at a quarter of five they were
suddenly awakened by the rattle of an old,
tumble-down cart, pulled by a haggard horse.
The girls sat up with a start, and looked at
each other and laughed.</p>

<p>Jumping to her feet in an instant, Louise
ran hastily towards the driver. He was staring
at them with great curiosity.</p>

<p>"We have been in an airplane accident, and
we want to get to a telephone&mdash;" began Louise.</p>

<p>But the man only shook his head and grinned.</p>

<p>"Nicht versteh'," he replied, helplessly.</p>

<p>"He's a foreigner," said Louise, turning
back to where Linda was standing. "A German,
who doesn't understand English."</p>

<p>"I can speak German," said Linda. "At
least, I had some, Freshman year. Let me try
him!"</p>

<p>But already he was driving away.</p>

<p>"Wo ghen Sie?" called Linda. "Warte!"</p>

<p>He stopped driving, evidently amazed at her
words, and pointed to the road ahead of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>Encouraged by this display of intelligence,
Louise jumped up on the cart, and waved her
arms in the direction of the airplane, in the
field half a mile away.</p>

<p>"We want <i>help</i>!" she cried. Then, turning to
Linda, "What's the German word for help?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered the other girl.
"But I think he understands. If he does meet
anybody, I think he'd send them to us."</p>

<p>So Louise climbed down again, and waved
good-by to the man as he continued on with his
cart, and, faintly encouraged, the girls went
back to the plane to eat their supper.</p>

<small><i>The Lost Necklace</i></small></h2>


<p>Many thoughts raced through Linda's mind,
as she and Louise sat beside the airplane, nibbling
at their frugal supper. For this time, they
had decided to eat sparingly; nobody knew how
long they might have to stay there, without
any more food.</p>

<p>But all of Linda's thoughts were regrets.
Regret that her father had met with an accident,
regret that Dan Stillman had borrowed
her Arrow, regret that she was unable to locate
the trouble herself and repair it.</p>

<p>Louise, with her usual practical cheerfulness,
interrupted these gloomy meditations.</p>

<p>"We have three good hours of daylight left,
Linda," she announced, glancing at her watch.
"To try another direction. There must be a real
road around here somewhere&mdash;where automobiles
go. Texas isn't the end of the world."</p>

<p>"If we're actually in Texas!" returned
Linda. "It may be Oklahoma, for all we know."</p>

<p>"But Oklahoma has roads, too. Come on, finish
your cake! We must hurry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking their coats along, for the night gave
promise of being cooler, the girls set off in the
opposite direction from the one they had taken
that afternoon. This time they had to go right
through the shrubbery&mdash;the dangerous shrubbery
which had threatened disaster to their
landing.</p>

<p>"This is awful!" exclaimed Louise, pausing
to pull a brier from her sweater. "There can't
be any road here."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I think we'll be more likely
to find one, once we get through this. The very
fact that we can't see beyond is hopeful."</p>

<p>"That's true," admitted Louise, starting on
again.</p>

<p>They walked for some time, carefully picking
their way through the undergrowth, thankful
that they were wearing breeches. At last they
came to a more open space, and stopped to look
about them.</p>

<p>"No road!" exclaimed Louise, in disappointment.</p>

<p>"But that looks like a stream over there,
Lou&mdash;between those two banks!" cried Linda.</p>

<p>"Oh, if it only is! Then we could have a
swim!"</p>

<p>"If we ought to take the time."</p>

<p>"I think we might as well, Linda, because it's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
going to get too dark for us to take a chance
getting lost tonight. Let's have our swim and
go back to the plane to sleep. Then tomorrow
morning we'll start to hike&mdash;if we have to go
all the way to the ranch on foot!"</p>

<p>"We won't have to do that, because we have
plenty of money," Linda reminded her. "Once
we get back to civilization, our dollars will be
some good. And, even if we have to leave the
Pursuit, and never see her again, it would be
worth it to get to Daddy!"</p>

<p>Having come to this decision, the girls hurried
rapidly towards the stream, and then, taking
off their flyers' suits carefully, under cover
of their coats, in case there should be some
human being around, they both plunged in.</p>

<p>The water felt cold, and oh, so refreshing!
They swam happily for some minutes, forgetful
of all their worries, in the joy of the invigorating
pastime.</p>

<p>When they had gone some distance, Linda
suddenly realized how swift the current was,
out in the middle of the creek. Already they
were several hundred yards downstream.</p>

<p>"Lou!" she called. "We must be careful of
this current!"</p>

<p>Her chum did not answer, and Linda suddenly
experienced another sickening moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of dread. Suppose Louise were unconscious!
She turned around, but she could not see the
other girl.</p>

<p>However, the creek turned sharply at this
point, and Linda reassured herself with the
hope that Louise was beyond the bend. She
swam in to where it was shallow enough for her
to stand up, and cupped her hands and called.</p>

<p>"Lou! Oh, Lou!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" came the instant reply. "Around the
bend."</p>

<p>Linda hurried around the cliff which separated
her chum from sight, and there, to her
amazement, she beheld a shattered airplane.
The wings and the propeller were gone&mdash;had
evidently been floated out on the stream and
swept away on the current, and the plane itself
was smashed to pieces. Louise was standing
beside it, holding a man's coat in her hand.</p>

<p>"Ye gods!" cried Linda, shocked by the horror
of such a wreck. "How terrible!"</p>

<p>But Louise was searching the pockets of the
coat madly, excitedly, as if she had no thought
for the man who had been killed.</p>

<p>"Look, Linda!" she cried triumphantly. "I
had an inspiration it might be your thief! I've
got it!"</p>

<p>"What?" demanded the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"The necklace!"</p>

<p>Both girls held their breath while Louise
steadied her nervous fingers and opened the box&mdash;a
cheap pasteboard affair, totally unlike the
original one in which Kitty Clavering's pearls
had been sold. To Linda's unbelieving eyes, she
held up the costly jewels.</p>

<p>Louise dropped down on the ground, absolutely
overcome with emotion, and Linda sat
beside her, examining the necklace for herself,
as if she could not believe her eyes. But there
was no doubt about it; it was the real thing
this time.</p>

<p>"That man didn't know much about flying,"
remarked Linda, finally. "I suppose, though,
he realized that his only chance of escape lay
in getting over the border.... But Lou, if his
coat is here, why isn't he?"</p>

<p>"He probably took off his coat before anything
happened. But his body may be somewhere
in the wreckage. I&mdash;I'd just as soon not
see it, wouldn't you, Linda?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," replied the other, with a
shudder of repulsion. "Come on, Lou, let's go.
But don't let's try to swim with that necklace.
I'd rather walk."</p>

<p>"So would I."</p>

<p>Both girls scrambled to their feet, and started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
back towards their coats. Suddenly Linda
stopped, horrified by what she saw. Over in a
little cove, away from the main stream, were
not one, but two bodies, half floating, half
caught on the shore by the weeds and underbrush.</p>

<p>"It's the thief, all right," she managed to
say. "And I wonder who the other man was."</p>

<p>Louise squinted her eyes; she had no desire
to go any closer, and in the fading light it was
hard to see clearly.</p>

<p>"He looks&mdash;as&mdash;if&mdash;he had red hair," she
announced, slowly. "That would explain about
the gasoline agent, who tried to put the blame
on Ted Mackay."</p>

<p>"Of course!" cried Linda. "Isn't it all horrible?
As if any necklace could be worth this! I
wonder when it happened."</p>

<p>"Probably last night, during the storm. That
would be too much for an inexperienced flyer."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>The girls picked up their clothing and dressed
hurriedly, reaching the plane just as it was
beginning to get dark.</p>

<p>"Let's make a fire," suggested Linda, "and
tell each other stories till we get sleepy. We
mustn't try to go to sleep too early on this hard
ground, especially after having had naps."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you scared at all, Linda?" asked
Louise.</p>

<p>"No. What of? Ghosts&mdash;or tramps?"</p>

<p>"Both."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not afraid of tramps or robbers
because I have my pistol&mdash;Daddy made me
promise to take it with me on all my flights&mdash;and
I'm just not going to let myself be worried
about ghosts. After all, those two dead men
deserved their fate, didn't they? And I mean
to forget them. Now, tell me a story!"</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"Some nice new novel you've read that I
haven't."</p>

<p>So Louise began the story of "Father Means
Well"&mdash;a very amusing book she had just finished,
and the girls kept their camp-fire going
until eleven o'clock. Then, when both were certain
that they were sleepy, they spread out
Louise's raincoat on the ground, and, crawling
close together, put Linda's on top of them. Almost
instantly they were asleep, forgetful of
accidents and thieves, not to waken until the
sun was brightly shining again.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XVIII" id="Chapter_XVIII"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVIII</span></a><br />
<small><i>In Pursuit of the "Pursuit"</i></small></h2>


<p>From the moment that Ted Mackay had been
shot by the thief who stole Kitty Clavering's
necklace, everything had gone wrong for him.
Not only had he been wounded and forced to
lose time from work, but the new plane, which
was worth thousands of dollars to his company,
had been stolen. And, in view of the fact that
the robber was not a licensed pilot, it was very
unlikely that the plane would stand the test,
even if it were ever recovered.</p>

<p>Then, added to his other troubles, Ted had
been accused of being in league with the thief!
Ralph Clavering believed he was guilty, and so
did Mr. Carlton. But what worried him most
was whether Linda thought so too.</p>

<p>The little nurse at the hospital had been a
great comfort, believing in Ted as she did, implicitly,
from the first. But when he had gone
home, he said nothing to his mother of the suspicions
aroused against him. The good woman
had enough to worry about, with the unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
life she led, and the constant menace of his
father's returning in trouble or in need of
money. But Ted's conscience was clear; all the
detective's in the world could not make him a
criminal when he knew that he was innocent.</p>

<p>He wasn't surprised, however, when two men
arrived at his home the day after he had reached
it. Two plainclothes men, with warrants for his
arrest.</p>

<p>His first anxiety was of course for his mother.
If she should believe that he was following
in his father's footsteps! Why, at her age, and
after all she had been through, the shock might
kill her! Her one comfort in life had always
been that her three children were fine, honest
citizens, that her teaching and training had been
rewarded.</p>

<p>Fortunately when the detectives arrived, she
was out in the back yard, working in her little
garden. But what could Ted do? To argue with
these men would only arouse her attention,
bring her hurrying to the front porch to see
what was the matter. For she seemed to live
in daily fear of trouble between her husband
and the law.</p>

<p>"But you have no evidence to arrest me,"
Ted objected, quietly, in answer to the man's
brusque statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are wrong there! We have evidence.
The gasoline agent, who sold you gas for the
plane. The description fits you perfectly&mdash;a
great big fellow, with red hair. Besides, you
were caught in the very place where the other
thief escaped."</p>

<p>"But I had nothing to do with it! I can prove
it!"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By other men in the company&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are they here?" interrupted the detective,
with a hard, sneering look.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you will come with us until such time
as you prove your innocence. One of us will
go inside with you while you get whatever
things you want."</p>

<p>Ted looked about him helplessly. Oh, how
could he keep the news from his mother? It
would break her heart!</p>

<p>And his career! What would this sort of thing
do to that? Did it mean that, just as he was
hoping to make his mark in the world, and rendering
valuable assistance to his family, all
must stop? With a gesture of utter despair he
gazed up into the skies, where he heard the
noise of an airplane, coming nearer and lower.</p>

<p>For a moment the other men forgot their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
duties, and likewise looked up into the air.
For the plane was certainly flying very low
indeed, actually circling over their heads. And
its roar was insistent; it would not be ignored.</p>

<p>At last it became plain to Ted that the pilot
wanted to land. So the young man held up his
arm and pointed to field on the right of his
house.</p>

<p>Wondering what its business could be, and
interested in the plane as everybody is, although
it is a common sight, the detectives
waited to find out what would happen.</p>

<p>What they actually saw was certainly worth
looking at. The pilot was an experienced flyer,
and his landing, in the small area of this field,
was as neat as anything they had ever witnessed.
Both men watched with admiration and
awe.</p>

<p>When the motor had been turned off, and the
pilot stepped from the plane, Ted recognized
him instantly. Sam Hunter&mdash;the best salesman,
the most experienced flyer of their company!</p>

<p>"Sam!" he exclaimed with genuine pleasure,
for although Ted had been with his firm only a
short time, this man was an old friend.</p>

<p>"Ted! Old boy! How are you?" cried the
other, clasping his hand in a hearty handshake.
"How's the shoulder?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty good," replied Ted. "I'm ready to
go back to work, if I take it a little easy. But&mdash;"
he paused and glanced at the two men beside
him&mdash;"these fellows don't want to let me."</p>

<p>"Doctors?" inquired Sam, though Ted's
manner of referring to them seemed queer&mdash;almost
rude. He hadn't introduced them&mdash;a
courtesy due them if they were doctors, or men
in any way worthy of respect.</p>

<p>"They're detectives," explained Ted. "Sorry
I can't introduce you, Sam, but they did not
favor me with their names. They've come here
with a warrant for my arrest."</p>

<p>"By heck!" ejaculated Sam. "Then the little
lady was right! The pretty aviatrix who was
so worried about you! And I'm just in time!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>Sam put his hand into his pocket, and produced
the paper which Mr. Jordan had dictated
and three of the men had signed. He handed it
to the detectives, both of whom read it at once.</p>

<p>"All right," said one of them, briefly, as he
handed it back to Sam. "Good-by."</p>

<p>Without another word they turned and fled
to their automobile and immediately drove
away.</p>

<p>Ted stood gazing at Sam in amazement, unable
to understand what his friend had done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
how he had been able to accomplish what seemed
like a miracle. In a few words the latter told
him of Linda's visit, and her insistence upon
the written alibi.</p>

<p>He finished his explanation and Ted had
just time to warn Sam not to mention the matter
to his mother, when the latter appeared,
dressed in a clean linen, beaming at both the
boys.</p>

<p>"Are you willing to have me take Ted back
again?" asked Sam, after he had been introduced.
"Because we need him, if he's well
enough to go."</p>

<p>"I'll be sorry to lose him, of course," she
answered with a motherly smile. "But I always
want Ted to do his duty. And I think he'll be
all right if he is careful. But first let me give
you an early supper, so that you can do most
of your flying by daylight."</p>

<p>Sam accepted the invitation with pleasure,
and as the boys sat down at five o'clock to that
splendid home-cooked meal, it seemed to Ted
that he was perfectly happy again. He knew now
that his company believed in his innocence;
best of all, he had the reassurance that Linda
Carlton shared that opinion!</p>

<p>It was good to be in a plane again, he thought,
as they took off, half an hour later. Good to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
up in the skies, with Sam&mdash;who was a friend
indeed!</p>

<p>The whole trip was pleasant, and Mr. Jordan's
greeting was just as cordial as Sam's.
When the former heard what a life-saver his
message had been, he was more impressed than
ever with the cleverness of the two girls who
had visited him.</p>

<p>"And if you'd like to see them and thank
them yourself," he continued, "I'll arrange for
you to combine it with a visit to our Denver
field. The girls are out there in Colorado, they
said&mdash;'Sunny Hills', I believe the name of the
village is."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir!" cried Ted, in delight and
gratitude. "I don't deserve that&mdash;after letting
that other plane get away from me!"</p>

<p>"Not your fault a bit!" protested the older
man. "We've got insurance. Still&mdash;if you could
happen to sell one on your trip, it would be a
big help to us."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best, Mr. Jordan. Now&mdash;when do
I start?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow morning. At dawn, if you like."</p>

<p>So it happened that when Linda and Louise
were taking off for their trip to Texas, that
was halted so sadly, Ted Mackay, at the very
same hour, was flying to Denver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>He reached his destination without mishap,
and went back to Sunny Hills that night. He
had some difficulty in finding the place, stopping
as the girls had, at the airport to inquire, and
reaching the Stillman estate about ten o'clock
that night.</p>

<p>Thinking naturally that the airplane was
Linda's, and that the girls were back again for
some reason, Roger and his brothers went out
to welcome them.</p>

<p>Ted explained quickly that he was a friend
of Miss Carlton&mdash;it was the first time he had
ever made such a statement, and there was
pride in his tone&mdash;and that, as he had just been
to Denver, he wanted to stop over here and see
her for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Shucks! That's too bad!" exclaimed Roger
with regret. "Miss Carlton left this morning
for her father's ranch in Texas."</p>

<p>Ted's smile faded; the ranch was the one
place where he could not visit Linda.</p>

<p>"But you must come in and make yourself
at home. Stay all night&mdash;you won't want to
fly any more tonight. Why!" he cried, noticing
Ted's bandage, "you've been hurt!"</p>

<p>"Last week," replied the other. "It's almost
well now. But&mdash;really, Mr. Stillman, though I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
thank you, I have no right to impose on your
hospitality!"</p>

<p>"It's a pleasure, I'm sure. Besides, I want
to look at your plane by daylight. I'm in the
market for a new airplane. My old one's being
repaired now, but it's so hopelessly out of date
I thought I'd try to trade it in."</p>

<p>Instantly Ted became the business man, the
salesman, and while he accepted Roger's invitation
to put his plane into the other's hangar,
he told of all its merits.</p>

<p>So interested were they that they talked for
an hour before they went into the house. Then
Roger was all apologies, for he knew Ted had
had no supper.</p>

<p>He hunted his mother, who was sitting disconsolately
at the telephone.</p>

<p>"I'm worried about the girls," she told them.
"They didn't phone from the ranch, as they
promised, and I have just finished calling it,
by long distance. They haven't arrived."</p>

<p>"But they had plenty of time!" insisted
Roger. "They started at seven o'clock this
morning!"</p>

<p>"Something must have happened," said
Mrs. Stillman, anxiously. "Airplanes are so
dangerous!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I know why&mdash;if anything did happen,"
explained Roger, slowly. "It isn't airplanes
that are so dangerous as inexperienced
pilots. I found out that Dan had Linda's plane
out last night, alone."</p>

<p>"Dan?" Mrs. Stillman was horrified. "But
he never flew alone in his life!"</p>

<p>"No, because I saw to it that he didn't. But
he admitted that he borrowed the Arrow last
night."</p>

<p>"This is serious," put in Ted. "We ought
to do something&mdash;right away!"</p>

<p>"What can we do? I made the girls a map,
but they may be off their course. I have no
plane&mdash;and your time's not your own, Mr.
Mackay."</p>

<p>"But I'll have to do something!" cried Ted,
excitedly. "Even if I lose my job on account
of it! It may be a question of life or death!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," decided Roger.
"I'll buy that plane of yours. I want it anyhow.
And tomorrow morning at dawn we'll go on a
search.... Now, mother, can you give Mr.
Mackay something to eat&mdash;and a room?"</p>

<p>Gratefully the young man accepted the hospitable
offers of his new friends and, pleased
with the sale he had put through, he fell instantly
asleep, not to awaken until Roger both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
knocked at his door and threw pillows at him
the next morning.</p>

<p>He dressed and they left in short order, after
a hearty breakfast, however, and armed with a
lunch perhaps not so dainty as that provided
for the girls, but at least as satisfying. Roger
reconstructed the map, like the one he had made
for Linda, and they flew straight for the nearest
airport.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, they got no information
there, no news of a wreck, or of two girls
flying in a biplane. But their time was not
wasted, for they took the opportunity to question
one of the flyers who seemed familiar
with the territory around him. They asked particularly
about the more lonely, desolate parts
of the near-by country, where an airplane accident
would not quickly be discovered.</p>

<p>"There's a stretch about ten miles south of
here," the man informed them, indicating a
spot on Roger's rough map. "Not a farm or a
village, as far as I know, except one old shack
where a German lives. He hid there during the
War, because he didn't want to be sent home,
and he has continued to live on there ever since.
He has a sort of garden, I believe&mdash;just enough
to keep him alive&mdash;with the fish he catches. And
a few apple trees. Once in a while he drives in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
here with his apples. I could tell you pretty
near where he lives, because I was stranded
there once myself. You could drop down and
ask him if he heard any planes."</p>

<p>Eagerly the two young men marked the spot
and set off once more in their plane, flying in
the direction indicated. Before nine o'clock they
came to the shack, which was the building that
Linda and Louise had spied at a distance. They
found the man frying fish on a fire in front of
his tumble-down house.</p>

<p>Their landing had been of sufficient distance
to avoid frightening him, but near enough for
him to hear them. They hurried towards him,
Roger almost shouting the question about the
girls, before he actually reached him.</p>

<p>But, like Linda and Louise, when they tried
to talk to this man, Roger received a shrug of
his shoulders in reply, and a muttered, "Nicht
versteh."</p>

<p>Unlike the girls, however, Roger commanded
a good knowledge of German, and he translated
the question with ease into the foreign language.</p>

<p>To both flyers' unbounded delight, they were
rewarded with the information that they so
longed to hear. The girls were safe&mdash;and not
far away!</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIX" id="Chapter_XIX"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIX</span></a><br />
<small><i>Rescued</i></small></h2>


<p>When the girls awakened at practically the
same time&mdash;for Louise, in stirring, moved
against Linda&mdash;they were horrified to see that
it was half past eight by their wrist watches.</p>

<p>"Two hours wasted!" groaned Louise. "And
it's going to be hot today! Oh, Linda, why
didn't we wake up at six?"</p>

<p>"Next time I'll bring an alarm clock,"
laughed her companion. "Come on, let's
straighten ourselves up. I&mdash;I&mdash;believe I'd
rather not swim!"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" agreed Louise, recalling the
horror they had witnessed the night before.
"We'll use what water we have&mdash;we can't
carry much on our hike anyway.... Now, let's
see what we have for breakfast."</p>

<p>"There's some fruit left, and a little bit of
chicken. With water to drink we'll have a fine
meal."</p>

<p>They sat down beside the plane to eat, and
both girls seemed to enjoy their breakfast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
meager as it was. For each had resolutely made
up her mind to be cheerful.</p>

<p>"Are the pearls safe?" asked Linda, as she
gathered up the chicken bones.</p>

<p>"In my pocket!" replied Louise, taking them
out for examination. "How about your pistol?"</p>

<p>"O.K.... Lou! Look! A plane!"</p>

<p>Both girls jumped instantly to their feet and
waved their arms and their coats in the air as
signals of distress. If only the pilot would look
down and see them!</p>

<p>He was flying low enough to make this perfectly
possible, but a moment later his ascent
sent a sickening disappointment into their
hearts. He was going away without even seeing
them! Useless to yell; no one could possibly hear
above the deafening noise. To be so near to a
rescue, and then to have it fail them in the end!</p>

<p>It was Linda, with her knowledge of flying,
who was the first to realize that the aviator
wasn't really going away, that he was only
retreating farther into the field to make a safe
landing, clear of them and their plane. In her
ecstasy she hugged Louise tightly.</p>

<p>"He's coming down, Lou! To rescue us!"</p>

<p>"How do you know?" demanded the other,
incredulously. "He seems to be going farther
away to me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, he isn't! It's only to land clear of us.
Lou, it must be Roger!"</p>

<p>"Roger? Why? How!"</p>

<p>"Because he would investigate, when we
failed to telephone!"</p>

<p>"But suppose it's another bandit&mdash;like&mdash;you
know! Get your revolver!"</p>

<p>"It's right here. But don't worry, Lou. Look!
He's on the ground!"</p>

<p>The pilot brought the beautiful new cabin
monoplane expertly to a stop and shut off the
engine. To the girls' amazement two men, not
one, stepped out. Both of them were old friends!</p>

<p>"Roger! Ted!" cried both the girls at once,
in their delight in recognizing them. They felt
as if they had been rescued from a desert island.</p>

<p>"You're both safe? Unhurt?" cried Roger,
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" murmured Ted, reverently.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;safe, but stranded," replied Louise.
"We've only seen one person since noon yesterday&mdash;and
he couldn't speak English!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, he's the one you owe the rescue
to!" replied Roger.</p>

<p>"You saw him?" demanded Linda, incredulously.
"But you must have been out hunting
for us, first, Roger. Oh, I think you're just
wonderful!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;the credit goes to Mr. Mackay," returned
Roger, modestly. "And the German fellow,
with his apple-cart." And he proceeded to
relate in detail everything that had led to their
pursuit and discovery.</p>

<p>"Your shoulder is all right, Ted?" inquired
Linda, after she heard that he was back at his
job.</p>

<p>"Yes, fine, thank you. And I can never thank
you enough for what you did for me, Linda!
I'll tell you all about it later."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was nothing!" protested the girl
lightly. Then, turning anxiously to Roger,
"Have you any news of my father?"</p>

<p>"He is alive, but that is all my mother could
learn last night from the housekeeper over the
telephone. But don't worry&mdash;you'll be there
yourself in a few hours!"</p>

<p>"How?" she asked, glancing helplessly at
her plane. "There's something wrong with my
motor. It may take a long time to fix&mdash;and&mdash;if
I go by train&mdash;Daddy might&mdash;" she stopped;
she just couldn't say "die."</p>

<p>"You're flying in my new plane!" Roger
informed her. "Which I have just purchased
from Mr. Mackay. We'll leave right away, or as
soon as he examines yours, so he can tell me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
what to send out to him here. We'll stop somewhere
and phone for help."</p>

<p>"Roger, would you really do that?" cried
Linda, in relief. "That would be wonderful!"</p>

<p>"A pleasure!" he said. "Now&mdash;tell us what
happened to you."</p>

<p>"I really don't know, except that the motor
acted awfully queer. But I was lucky enough
to make a safe landing."</p>

<p>"It was just dreadful," put in Louise. "I
was absolutely certain we were going to be
killed. Linda was wonderful."</p>

<p>"She's a fine little pilot," said Ted, admiringly.
"Shows she can keep her head in an
emergency&mdash;and that's one of the most important
things for an aviator.... Now, let's have
a look at the plane."</p>

<p>They all went with him while he examined
it.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't fix it without some new
parts, and some special tools," he said, making
notes as he spoke. "But it's nothing that can't
be repaired quickly. If you'll telephone our
Denver field, Mr. Stillman, and read this note
to the mechanic, they'll send a man out. And
as soon as it's fixed, I'll pilot it to you at the
ranch, Linda.... Be sure to give me the di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>rections....
Now, have you girls had anything
to eat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we had supper last night," answered
Louise, "left over from our picnic lunch,
and we even saved some fruit and some chicken
for breakfast."</p>

<p>"Then you people might as well start," urged
Ted. "No use wasting time."</p>

<p>"One thing more," added Louise, while Linda
busied herself writing the directions for Ted,
"we almost forgot! We found a wrecked plane
last night&mdash;two men dead&mdash;and recovered the
necklace!"</p>

<p>"What?" demanded Ted, in consternation.</p>

<p>Roger, however, did not know what they were
talking about, and no one had time to explain.</p>

<p>"The wreck's over by a stream&mdash;about half
a mile beyond those bushes," Louise informed
Ted. "You can explore it while you're waiting."</p>

<p>"And maybe salvage some of it!" added Ted,
hopefully.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the other three took off
in the new plane, Louise somehow sitting on
Linda's lap. It wasn't very comfortable, but it
would not be for far. They would descend at
the nearest landing place, Roger getting in
touch with Denver, while Louise called Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Carlton, Mrs. Stillman, and her parents, and
then summoned a taxicab, to take her to a railroad
station.</p>

<p>The rest of the trip was smooth and uneventful.
Once only did they make a stop after Louise
left&mdash;that time to get some lunch at a hotel in
Fort Worth. In another hour they reached the
ranch and landed right on Mr. Carlton's field,
for Linda knew from former directions just
where the best spot would be.</p>

<p>"Come in with me, Roger," she invited, trying
to keep her voice steady.</p>

<p>They approached the house, an old-fashioned,
rambling affair, and knocked at the screen door.
A middle-aged woman, neatly dressed, came
through the hall.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mrs. Cates," said Linda.
"I am Mr. Carlton's daughter, and this is Mr.
Stillman, who has brought me in his plane."</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," replied the older woman.
"Come right in, my dear. I've been expecting
you."</p>

<p>Linda had been watching her face, to try to
ascertain from her expression whether the news
of her father was bad.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how&mdash;is Daddy?" she asked, with
trembling lips, as she and Roger followed Mrs.
Cates into the big room where her father evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>dently
spent most of his indoor hours. A huge
fireplace occupied most of one wall, and there
were many book-shelves. A table, a few chairs,
and an old couch were all the other furnishings,
so that the great room looked almost empty and
desolate without its master.</p>

<p>"He is still alive&mdash;but unconscious," sighed
Mrs. Cates, shaking her head mournfully. Her
expression was one of resignation; she felt sure
that Mr. Carlton could not get better.</p>

<p>"Unconscious!" repeated Linda. "Has he
been so, long?"</p>

<p>"Ever since his fall. He was riding a new
horse&mdash;that he never should have bought&mdash;and
was thrown down a steep bank. His leg is
broken, but worse than that, he suffered severe
internal injuries. Dr. Winston is afraid there
ain't much hope."</p>

<p>The words were the cruelest Linda had ever
heard; she burst out crying, and hid her face
on Mrs. Cates' motherly shoulder. Roger Stillman
remained standing, embarrassed. He did
not know what to do.</p>

<p>He coughed slightly, and Linda looked up,
ashamed of herself for breaking down.</p>

<p>"Is there anything at all, Linda, that I can
do for you?" he asked. "Or for you, Mrs.
Cates?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid not, thank you, Roger," replied
the girl. "But don't you want something to eat
before you start back?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks. I ought to be home early this
evening, and I'll get supper then. I'm not a
bit hungry now." And with a sympathetic handshake,
he left her.</p>

<p>"Would you like to go to your room, my dear&mdash;or
do you want to see your father first?"
asked the housekeeper. "I have him here on
the ground floor."</p>

<p>"I want to see Daddy!" replied Linda, wiping
the tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>The older woman led her across the hall to
a room where the door was open, and she caught
sight of her father, lying almost lifeless upon
the bed. Impulsively Linda rushed in to him. It
just didn't seem possible that he wouldn't recognize
her, and hold out his arms to receive
her!</p>

<p>But he continued to lie death-like upon the
bed, his head motionless upon the pillow. His
eyes were closed.</p>

<p>"Daddy! Daddy darling!" she cried, in a
voice that shook with pain. Dropping to her
knees, she knelt beside his bed, and covered his
limp hand with kisses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was no response whatever to her
greeting!</p>

<p>For some time she stayed there, praying that
he would get better. Mrs. Cates had left them
alone, but in half an hour she came back.</p>

<p>"Come, my dear, you must get some rest.
Take off your clothing, and wash your face and
hands and lie down for a while. Then perhaps
you will be able to eat some supper."</p>

<p>Obediently Linda did as she was told, for
she realized that the housekeeper was only trying
to be kind. And, after a short nap, she had
to admit that she felt better.</p>

<p>"Any change, Mrs. Cates?" was her first
question, when she sat down to supper with
the woman and her husband. The rest of the
help ate in the kitchen, but Mrs. Cates realized
that this was no time for the girl to be alone.</p>

<p>"No. Not a bit."</p>

<p>"Oughtn't there to be a trained nurse?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Winston didn't think so. I'm doing what
needs to be done."</p>

<p>"When will the doctor be back?"</p>

<p>"Tonight, after supper."</p>

<p>Somehow Linda felt dissatisfied, as if enough
were not being done. Another doctor should
have been called in&mdash;a surgeon, perhaps. And
surely a trained nurse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>She spoke of these things to Dr. Winston
when he came over about eight o'clock that evening.
But he shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid nothing can save your father,
my child," he said. "There's only one chance
in a thousand he might get well, if we operated.
And there's only one surgeon in the United
States who ever had any success with that sort
of operation."</p>

<p>"But if there is <i>one</i>!" cried Linda, eagerly
jumping to the tiny hope his words suggested.
"We must get that surgeon! Who is he? Where
is he?" She was talking rapidly, excitedly, almost
incoherently.</p>

<p>"He is a Dr. Lineaweaver. A marvelous man.
But I happen to know he is away on his vacation
now."</p>

<p>"Where does he go?"</p>

<p>"That I don't know."</p>

<p>"But you know where he lives?"</p>

<p>"Yes. St. Louis."</p>

<p>"Then won't you please call his home and
find out where he is, and I'll go for him as soon
as I get my plane back."</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's too late, my child. I&mdash;I&mdash;doubt
if your father will live through the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
And you couldn't fly at night&mdash;even if your
plane were here."</p>

<p>"I can&mdash;and will! And I think I hear my
plane now&mdash;yes, I'm sure that's it. Get me the
address&mdash;quick&mdash;and you put in the call while
I run out and see my plane! And try to get a
trained nurse immediately. I'll be back before
dawn&mdash;unless the surgeon's in Europe or
Canada!"</p>

<p>And, dashing in to give her father one kiss,
she hurried out to find faithful Ted Mackay,
alighting from her beloved Arrow.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XX" id="Chapter_XX"><span class="smcap">Chapter XX</span></a><br />
<small><i>The Race against Death</i></small></h2>


<p>"Ted!"</p>

<p>"Linda!"</p>

<p>"You can't know how thankful I am to see
you!" cried the girl. "It&mdash;it&mdash;may mean that I
can save my father's life!" And she told him
of her plans.</p>

<p>"If I could only go with you!" sighed the
young man. "I hate to think of you flying alone
at night!"</p>

<p>"But you do believe I'm capable, don't you,
Ted?" Linda's eyes searched his for the truth;
she was not asking for flattery, she really wanted
his opinion.</p>

<p>"Yes indeed I do!" Ted answered, with assurance.
"But it's always safer for two pilots
to go together. However, the Pursuit is in fine
shape now&mdash;and filled up with gas.... Linda,
I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"About the wreck&mdash;and&mdash;those thieves....
The other dead man was my father."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your father! Ted!" Every bit of color left
the girl's face. What a dreadful, ghastly thing
to happen to anybody, and especially to a fine
boy like Ted! To come upon his father, dead, in
that abrupt fashion, and to know, worst of all,
that he had died in disgrace!</p>

<p>Finding no words to express her sympathy,
she pressed his hand tightly in silence.</p>

<p>"So you see how much I have to do&mdash;why I
can't go with you," he continued. "I have reported
the wreck to my company, and made
arrangements about my father's body. But I
must go right home to my mother."</p>

<p>"But how do you explain it all, Ted?" Linda
asked.</p>

<p>"I think my father was paying one of his
regular visits to the Spring City Flying School&mdash;he
came there once in so often to get money
from me&mdash;and he was disappointed to find I had
gone. Whether he knew that other man before,
I don't know, but it would seem probable that
he did. Together they must have cooked up the
scheme to follow your plane and get the necklace....
That is why it is really fortunate
the man got the necklace by a ruse. You see he
was armed with a gun&mdash;as I later found out,
and if he had had to fight for the jewels, I'm
sure he wouldn't have hesitated to fire on you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I suppose your father's being involved
would explain why you were suspected," added
Linda. "You look like him, I believe."</p>

<p>"Yes. To my regret."</p>

<p>"But perhaps it's better as it is," concluded
Linda. "Don't you feel so, Ted?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. It&mdash;will be so much easier for my
mother.... But Linda, we mustn't stand here
talking. Every minute is precious to you."</p>

<p>"No. I can't go till Dr. Winston comes out
with the surgeon's address. He's putting in a
long distance call. However, I will go in and
change into my flyer's suit, if you don't mind,"
she added.</p>

<p>Five minutes later she reappeared with the
information that Dr. Lineaweaver was in Louisiana&mdash;at
a small seaport town which Ted instantly
located on a map that he gave to Linda.</p>

<p>"I won't even start off with you," the young
man said, "because that would mean an extra
stop for you. Now&mdash;are you sure you are all
right&mdash;and that you can stay awake?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure," replied the girl, forcing a
smile. "Mrs. Cates has just given me a thermos
bottle full of coffee, and a sandwich, to help
me!"</p>

<p>A moment later she climbed into the cockpit
and started the motor. The Pursuit, whose en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>gine
purred with the smooth even whir of one
in perfect order, gained speed until it rose into
the air. It was Linda's first flight at night.</p>

<p>Darkness was all around her, but overhead
the stars shone brightly, and the moon came
from behind a cloud to light her way. Strange,
lonely, mysterious, it seemed to her, as she flew
through the night, but nevertheless thrilling.
Gradually a sense of peace settled over her, as
if a Divine Providence was surely guiding her,
and she experienced the firm conviction that
everything was right, that she was going to
be successful in her mission to save her father's
life.</p>

<p>For the first time she realized how much her
confidence had to do with Ted Mackay. Because
he had repaired and inspected the motor, she
felt certain there would be no accident, and a
successful flight was a good omen for the operation.
Moreover, she had great faith in Dr. Lineaweaver.
If he would only promise to come!</p>

<p>The hours passed, the moon set, the night
grew darker. But the solitary girl flew on, swift
and straight to her course, steadfast in her
undertaking. About two o'clock she arrived at
the little seaport, found a landing place back
of the one big hotel, and went inside.</p>

<p>Fortunately a night clerk was on duty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
he rose immediately to greet her. The flyer's
costume identified her so that he had no need
to ask what a girl of her age was doing alone at
this early hour of the morning.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where Dr. Lineaweaver,
the surgeon, can be located?" she inquired. "I
want him immediately&mdash;it is a question of my
father's life."</p>

<p>Her voice was steady now; there was no danger
of tears. She seemed almost mature as she
spoke the words.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the clerk. "He is staying at
Dr. Grayson's bungalow&mdash;a couple of blocks
away. They come over here for their meals."</p>

<p>"Could you get him on the telephone for
me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I'll let you talk with him."</p>

<p>Although the clerk put in the call immediately,
there was no answer for several minutes.
A fishing trip had tired both doctors, and they
were sleeping soundly. At last, however, there
came a reply, and Linda took the telephone.</p>

<p>In a few words the unhappy girl apologized
for the call at that hour, and during the surgeon's
holiday, and briefly told her story.
Eagerly she pleaded with him to dress and come
immediately, informing him that she had her
plane waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean you flew from Texas alone&mdash;at
this hour of the night!" exclaimed the surgeon.</p>

<p>"Yes. But you needn't be afraid, Doctor, to
go with me. I'm quite experienced. Oh please,
please, say yes!"</p>

<p>"I'll be at the hotel in ten minutes," replied
the great man. "And meanwhile, you get something
to eat."</p>

<p>Linda sank gratefully into a chair, thinking
that the hardest part of her task was over&mdash;the
winning of Dr. Lineaweaver's consent to
break into his vacation and go back with her.
Now, if her father only lived until they returned,
all would surely be well!</p>

<p>Still keeping herself in control, she ate her
sandwich and drank her coffee, while she waited
for the doctor to come. True to his word, he
appeared in exactly ten minutes.</p>

<p>The flight back to the ranch was much pleasanter
than the one to the seaport. No longer was
Linda alone; it was a comfort to have the great
surgeon with her, to know that he would do all
in his power to save her father. The darkness
gradually faded, giving place to a faint gray,
and finally to a beautiful, inspiring sunrise. A
dawn that perhaps meant new life to her father!</p>

<p>It did not take Dr. Lineaweaver long to real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>ize
that Linda was an accomplished pilot, and
he settled back into his seat in full enjoyment
of the ride. His surprise at her youth&mdash;she was
much younger than he had supposed from the
telephone conversation&mdash;gradually gave way
to admiration of her skill and her poise. He had
no fear for his own safety; he was confident
that she would make the journey without a
mishap.</p>

<p>About seven o'clock she brought the Pursuit
to a stop on the field that belonged to her father's
ranch. Cates was already there to greet
them.</p>

<p>"Is my father still alive?" she demanded,
with the first indication of any strain in her
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," came the reassuring reply. "He is
just the same."</p>

<p>"And did you succeed in getting a nurse?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Dr. Winston's here too.... Now, the
Mrs. said to bring you both in for a hot breakfast."</p>

<p>Linda was so excited that she did not see
how she could possibly eat, but when she realized
that the surgeon must take time for something,
she finally agreed. But first she tiptoed
in for a look at her father, and gave him a kiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
that was really a prayer. A white-clad nurse
smiled at her, and she believed hopefully that
all was well.</p>

<p>The inaction, the weary, tense waiting of the
next two hours was more difficult for Linda than
her flight to Louisiana, alone in the darkness.
She had nothing to do. Sleep was out of the
question, yet she was terribly tired. But she
could not sit still; aimlessly she followed Mrs.
Cates around, begging for work. At last the
good woman, realizing that the girl could not
rest, set her to washing dishes and preparing
vegetables for the noon-day meal.</p>

<p>But finally the operation was over, and
Linda's heart stood still as she heard Dr. Winston
coming out of her father's room. Suppose
it had all been in vain! She covered her face
with her hands, she dared not trust herself to
look into his eyes, that would tell her, before he
could utter the words, whether her father had
lived.</p>

<p>And then came the glorious news that set
her heart to singing as if the whole world had
been recreated in joy and happiness:</p>

<p>"Your father is doing nicely, Miss Carlton....
Dr. Lineaweaver believes that he will get
well."</p>

<p>Now the tears came in floods, tears of thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>fulness
and gladness, and she hugged Mrs.
Cates in her ecstasy.</p>

<p>"It was a wonderful operation," continued
Dr. Winston. "Dr. Lineaweaver is the greatest
surgeon I have ever had the honor to watch."</p>

<p>"Thank God! Thank God!" murmured Mrs.
Cates, reverently.... "And now, honey, you
must go and get some sleep!"</p>

<p>"Not till I've thanked Dr. Lineaweaver!"
protested Linda, and she ran off like a happy
child, unmindful of the terrible strain she had
just been through.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Chapter_XXI" id="Chapter_XXI"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXI</span></a><br />
<small><i>Honors for Linda</i></small></h2>


<p>When Linda was permitted, the following
day, to go in to see her father, she found him
conscious, but she knew from his expression
that he was suffering severe pain. However, he
managed a feeble smile as she entered, that
sent a surge of joy to her heart.</p>

<p>"Daddy!" she exclaimed, her voice choked
with thankfulness, "you are going to get well!"</p>

<p>He gave an almost imperceptible nod.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, thanks to you," he managed to
murmur.</p>

<p>"You mean thanks to the Pursuit&mdash;and to Dr.
Lineaweaver," she corrected. She wanted to
add Ted Mackay's name to the list, but she felt
it would not be wise.</p>

<p>Her father smiled; it was like Linda to disclaim
any credit for herself.</p>

<p>"I phoned Aunt Emily last night," she
added, "and she is coming out in a couple of
days."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, don't let her make a fuss over me,"
was his unexpected reply.</p>

<p>Linda squeezed his hand jubilantly; he was
talking like himself again!</p>

<p>She did not stay with him long&mdash;the nurse
thought fifteen minutes was enough&mdash;but she
was satisfied. Now that she felt sure he was
getting better, time no longer hung heavy on
her hands. There was so much to do at the
ranch&mdash;so many activities that she enjoyed.
Hiking, fishing, riding horseback, even helping
Cates with the kitchen garden or driving the
battered Ford into Fort Worth on errands.</p>

<p>Her aunt arrived a few days later, bringing
a trunk as usual. Linda laughed at the idea of
carrying so many clothes to a ranch&mdash;she practically
lived in her old riding-breeches and
khaki shirt-waists&mdash;but Miss Carlton could not
be comfortable unless she was perfectly dressed.</p>

<p>"Linda, my darling!" exclaimed the older
woman, as they kissed each other. "Think how
near I came to losing you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Aunt Emily, you mustn't say that!
Even though Lou and I were stranded, there
was no danger of our dying. We could have
hiked the whole way home, if it had been necessary."</p>

<p>"But you <i>almost</i> had a serious accident!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, we didn't. And since my plane saved
Daddy's life, you're converted to them now,
aren't you?" pleaded the girl.</p>

<p>"I do think they're useful," admitted the
other. "And I really believe that you are an
exceptionally fine pilot, my dear."</p>

<p>"It's awfully sweet of you to say that, Aunt
Emily.... But don't let's talk about it any
more. Come in and see Daddy. He's expecting
you."</p>

<p>Miss Carlton was amazed and delighted to
find that her brother's progress had been so
rapid, and she began to talk immediately about
taking him back to Green Falls with her, in a
week or so. He could bring his nurse with him,
perhaps charter a private car.</p>

<p>"Must we go back so soon, Aunt Emily?"
asked Linda. "I love it here!"</p>

<p>"It's too wild for me," replied Miss Carlton.
"And too lonely. Besides, we have to be on
hand for Field Day. It's the biggest event of
the summer at Green Falls."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Linda pleasantly.
"Whatever you say."</p>

<p>"By the way, did you tell your father about
finding the necklace? When Louise came home
with it, I thought Kitty Clavering'd go crazy!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Such a queer circumstance, too&mdash;you girls
finding it the way you did!"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't tell Daddy yet," replied Linda,
blushing. She had been afraid to bring Ted's
name, or his father's, into the conversation
with her father, when he was still so ill.</p>

<p>"You see, Daddy," she explained, turning
to him, as he lay there quietly on his bed, "Lou
and I were taking a trip in the Pursuit, and
something went wrong with the motor, forcing
us to land in a desolate spot. After our picnic
supper, while Lou and I went swimming, we&mdash;we&mdash;came
upon a wrecked plane, and&mdash;and&mdash;two
dead men. The two thieves!" She paused,
but suddenly remembered that her aunt did
not know that one of the men was Ted's father,
for that fact had been ascertained after Louise
left. "And we got the necklace!"</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Mr. Carlton, in amazement
at their luck, and horror at the experience.
"Pretty sickening for you two girls! But,
by the way, did the other fellow have red hair?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did. Though Lou and I only saw
him from a distance. We didn't want to go too
near, for luckily the necklace was in the man's
coat beside the wreck, and the bodies were some
distance away."</p>

<p>Seeing that the subject was unpleasant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Linda, Mr. Carlton never mentioned it to her
again during her entire visit.</p>

<p>Three weeks passed happily, and her father
was sitting up in his chair, when her aunt's
restlessness became so apparent that Linda
was willing to go back to Green Falls.</p>

<p>"You see I'm on the committee for Field
Day, my dear," explained Miss Carlton, apologetically.
"Besides, I hope you can take part
in the events."</p>

<p>"How could I, Aunt Emily? I'm not in practice
for golf or tennis, or any of the contests.
I'm afraid I'd be a joke."</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps you might enter the airplane
competitions," suggested her aunt, to
Linda's consternation.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean it, Aunt Emily?" cried
the girl, in delight. "Why, I'd adore that!"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see what the program calls for.
If it isn't anything too dangerous, like parachute
jumping.... And another thing&mdash;it is
very important for you to be on hand, because
Louise is planning a surprise that you don't
want to miss."</p>

<p>"Is she going to announce her engagement
to Ralph Clavering, or Harriman Smith?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of! She isn't engaged to
Ralph, is she?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"She wasn't when I last saw her. But absence
often lends enchantment, you know!"</p>

<p>Miss Carlton looked searchingly into her
niece's eyes, but she could see only laughter
in them. "Wouldn't you mind a bit, Linda, if
Louise married Ralph?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly I'd mind," replied the girl
seriously, "I don't think Ralph&mdash;or any other
boy we know&mdash;is good enough for Lou!"</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all. Marriage is too serious for
either of us&mdash;yet.... Now tell me, Auntie,
what you meant by that surprise!"</p>

<p>"You wait and see! It's something you'll
like."</p>

<p>Linda thought perhaps it was the delightful
party that greeted her when she landed, three
days later, at Green Falls. All of the old crowd
were there to welcome her&mdash;Louise and Dot
Crowley, the two Claverings, Jim Valier and
Harriman Smith, Sara Wheeler, Sue Emery,
Maurice Stetson, and Joe Sinclair. They presented
her with a beautiful little silver airplane,
a model for her desk, which served a useful purpose
as a stamp-box. Miss Carlton, who had
arrived the day before by train, had arranged
an elaborate dinner for the whole party.</p>

<p>There was so much to talk about&mdash;the cham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>pionships
the young people were hoping to win,
the airplane stunts for which two noted flyers
had been engaged, the contests in flying that
anyone with a private pilot's license might
enter. In this last event they were all hoping
to star Linda.</p>

<p>"Even a race, Linda," said Ralph, who
seemed to have forgotten all about their quarrel.
"You'll enter, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" replied the girl, her eyes
shining with anticipation. "Aunt Emily has
already given her consent."</p>

<p>Thinking there had been enough talking and
too little dancing, Kitty Clavering suggested
that they turn on the radio. She was wearing
her pearl necklace, and rushing over every few
minutes to kiss Linda or Louise, in appreciation
of their having recovered it.</p>

<p>"This is to be our last party, for almost a
week," she said. "Ralph says we all have to go
in training&mdash;though I'd never win anything if
I trained for years. But I can't do much, with
all the rest of you practicing tennis and golf
and swimming every minute, and going to bed
at ten o'clock! So let's make this party good!"</p>

<p>The evening passed happily, and no one but
Kitty seemed to resent the fact that they gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
up social activities and late hours for a few
days. They all worked seriously at their own
particular sports, and Linda practiced loops
and speeding with her plane.</p>

<p>Labor Day dawned, hot but clear&mdash;splendid
weather for the out-door event of the season.
The Casino and the grounds around it were
gayly decorated for the fÃªte; a band supplied
music whenever there was a lull, and refreshment-booths
everywhere offered an opportunity
for the guests to eat outside, if they did not prefer
the more formal luncheon and dinner
served at the restaurant.</p>

<p>Golf tournaments, swimming races and diving
contests were on the program for the
morning, and the finals in tennis were to be
played off soon after lunch. Then came archery
and quoits, drills by the Boy Scouts and a
pageant by the Girl Scouts. The last thing
before supper was the exhibition of flying.</p>

<p>Linda had decided not to go to the grounds
in the morning, for she wanted to have a mechanic
inspect her plane, to ascertain that
everything was just right before her participation
in the most spectacular event of the day.
She arrived soon after luncheon in the Pursuit,
leaving it at the runway behind the grounds,
and strolling over to the tennis matches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
watched Ralph capture the men's singles' cup,
and Dot Crowley take the women's.</p>

<p>She found the archery contest interesting,
and almost wished she had entered, for her
father had taught her the art of the bow. However,
on the whole she was satisfied to concentrate
all her energy upon flying.</p>

<p>The acrobatics came first on the program;
two aviators of considerable repute in their
profession had been advertised, although their
names had not yet been divulged. What was
Linda's amazement, when she heard Edward
Mackay and Sam Hunter being introduced by
the chairman! This had been her aunt's doing,
no doubt, for the latter was on the committee.
Was this the surprise she had so mysteriously
mentioned, and if so, what was Louise's part in
it?</p>

<p>A hush fell over the huge throng as they
watched the two flyers ascend into the air and
demonstrate all sorts of stunts for their amusement.
The falling leaf, the Immelman turn, the
inside loop, and the much more difficult outside
loop&mdash;and a number of others to which even
Linda could not give a name. Then finally, from
a height of five thousand feet, Ted Mackay
stepped off in a parachute and came safely to
the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>While she had been watching these skillful
yet dangerous performances, Linda's heart
beat fast with excitement, her breath came in
little gasps of fear or relief, as the stunt began
fearfully or ended in safety. But now that her
own turn was coming, she was surprisingly
calm and self-possessed.</p>

<p>With five other amateur flyers, all of whom
were young men, she taxied along the runway
and took off into the air, mounting to fifteen
hundred feet, carefully keeping clear of her
opponents. The looping began; she completed
one inside loop after another, until she had
scored six. Then she realized that she was too
near the ground to take a chance with another,
and it was too late to ascend again. With the
wisdom of an Earhart or a Lindbergh, who
never sacrifices safety for the sake of foolish
publicity, she cautiously landed. A few minutes
later the other planes all came down. Only one
pilot, a college boy whom she had just met,
scored over her by completing ten loops.</p>

<p>After a short interval of rest, the signal
that was to start the race was given, and a moment
later the gun went off, and six planes
ascended again, this time aiming for speed.</p>

<p>As the Pursuit soared smoothly upward and
then straight ahead, Linda experienced a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
surge of pride&mdash;not for herself, but for her
wonderful little plane. It was almost as if it
were a living thing, like a beloved horse. So
light, so easy to guide, so sure of its power!
On and on it sped, forging its way ahead, passing
now one plane and then another until it
came abreast of the leader. The thrill, the intoxication
of the race took possession of the
young aviatrix, and she urged it on to its fullest
speed.</p>

<p>Now she was passing the one that had looked
like the winner from the first! The shouts of
her friends below were inaudible to her, but
she could feel their applause in her heart. In
another second the gun went off with a loud
explosion which even the pilots could hear.
The race was over; Linda Carlton, the only
feminine entry, had won!</p>

<p>Her friends, even acquaintances and strangers,
almost mobbed her when she finally landed.
And the college boy who had come in second
was nicest of all. He and Ralph, forming a seat
with their hands, carried her high above their
shoulders, through the crowd to the Casino
where the prizes were to be awarded.</p>

<p>Two cups had been provided as a reward for
the looping and the racing, and, amid the applause
of hundreds, Linda and her new friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
received them. But that was not all; the chairman
held up his arm for silence.</p>

<p>"I have another privilege!" he shouted, and
the people suddenly became quiet. "Our club,
which among other things fosters aviation for
useful purposes, and is always on the lookout
for deeds of courage which result in the saving
of life, wishes to make an award for such an
action. We have discovered, entirely unknown
to her, that Miss Carlton made a record flight
to bring a noted surgeon to her dying father,
in time to perform the operation that saved his
life. I therefore take great pleasure in awarding
this medal to Miss Linda Carlton, of Green
Falls!"</p>

<p>A deep wave of color surged over the girl's
face as she listened to her own name in connection
with the speaker's words. Was it possible
that this great honor should come to her, when
she had merely performed her duty, and been
thankful to be able to do it? Her knees shook,
her eyelids fluttered, as she blushingly stepped
forward again. But she caught sight of Louise
among the crowd&mdash;Lou, who had arranged this
as her surprise&mdash;and then she saw her aunt,
with Ted beside her, and she suddenly felt at
ease, and smiled.</p>

<p>It was over at last, the applause and the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>gratulations,
and Linda was walking with these
three back to her plane when she noticed a
wheelchair, pushed by a white-clad nurse. It
must be&mdash;it was&mdash;her father!</p>

<p>"Daddy!" she cried, pushing her way
through the crowd to him. "You are here! How
wonderful!"</p>

<p>"It is you who are wonderful, my dear girl!"
he returned. "I am prouder than I have ever
been in my life!"</p>

<p>"Daddy&mdash;" she lowered her voice&mdash;"you
don't mind my being with Ted Mackay? Because
Aunt Emily&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course not!" he interrupted. "I know
all about the boy's part in saving you&mdash;your
aunt told me. I&mdash;I&mdash;am ready to admit I was
wrong. You will forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" She smiled joyfully;
there was so much to be happy about now.
"And may I have him for a friend?" she asked,
timidly.</p>

<p>"So long as you don't marry him&mdash;or anybody
else&mdash;for a long time!"</p>

<p>Her reply was reassuring:</p>

<p>"I won't, Daddy dear! My career as a flyer
has only just begun!"</p>


<p class="center">THE END</p>
